The primary attribute one would need to consider is that the sound is
very dispersed, but it all comes from less than 180 degrees in front
of where the microphone would be located.

I'm looking for an ideal microphone type, best suited for that job.

Also, where would be an ideal location to place the mics?  High, low,
middle, far from the band, close to the band?

Also, would I need more than 2?

Johann...'.

- Tones / Sounds: While I don't recall any particular piece of music
from the tape (album); I do, however, distinctively recall the tones /
sounds. For instance, the sound heard in the background on track 11 of
Prodigy's Music for Jilted Generation (1:31 ? 37 into the song), and
several others bits on this particular track (are likely the same
synthesizer).

I require Artist and Album information.

<#779751> dc:description """I was given a copy of the album in question (on tape; with no info) in
the late 80's, while I was pre-teen. I never discovered any
information about the album or artist; although, I do recall hearing
some of the music on European TVs (series, news spots, etc.) around
the same period.

Only clues I can offer:

- I am 99% certain that the artist is European (most likely German).

- The album started with a German speaking announcer introducing
'Johann ???' (I think) to a cheering crowed: 'Damen und Herren,
Johann...'.

- Tones / Sounds: While I don't recall any particular piece of music
from the tape (album); I do, however, distinctively recall the tones /
sounds. For instance, the sound heard in the background on track 11 of
Prodigy's Music for Jilted Generation (1:31 ? 37 into the song), and
several others bits on this particular track (are likely the same
synthesizer).

I require Artist and Album information.

- The album started with a German speaking announcer introducing
'Johann ???' (I think) to a cheering crowed: 'Damen und Herren,
Johann...'.

from the tape (album); I do, however, distinctively recall the tones /

Prodigy's Music for Jilted Generation (1:31 ? 37 into the song), and
several others bits on this particular track (are likely the same

- The album started with a German speaking announcer introducing
'Johann ???' (I think) to a cheering crowed: 'Damen und Herren,
Johann...'.

from the tape (album); I do, however, distinctively recall the tones /

Prodigy's Music for Jilted Generation (1:31 ? 37 into the song), and
several others bits on this particular track (are likely the same

- The album started with a German speaking announcer introducing
'Johann ???' (I think) to a cheering crowed: 'Damen und Herren,
Johann...'.

- Tones / Sounds: While I don't recall any particular piece of music
from the tape (album); I do, however, distinctively recall the tones /
sounds. For instance, the sound heard in the background on track 11 of
Prodigy's Music for Jilted Generation (1:31 ? 37 into the song), and
several others bits on this particular track (are likely the same
synthesizer).

- The album started with a German speaking announcer introducing
'Johann ???' (I think) to a cheering crowed: 'Damen und Herren,
Johann...'.

- Tones / Sounds: While I don't recall any particular piece of music
from the tape (album); I do, however, distinctively recall the tones /
sounds. For instance, the sound heard in the background on track 11 of
Prodigy's Music for Jilted Generation (1:31 ? 37 into the song), and
several others bits on this particular track (are likely the same
synthesizer).

Johann...'.

<#780488> dc:description """Hi. I was on vaccation in Turkey 2002 (during the Soccer World
Champoinship). I'm looking for a song that was played alot in the
radio as well as in restaurants during the time of my stay. I got the
feeling that this song was a radio-'Hit' that summer. The song was
relatively calm and slow with a (I my view) nice melody played on some
kind of flute. I don't think there was a drum beat, and if if there
were drums, they were discrete. The song was in Turkish (I guess). The
singer was a male. The main melody is both singed by the singer and
played by the flute in the middle play. The singer sings the melody
remarkeable 'stronger /more intense' later on in the song. I'm a
little bit uncertain, but mu guess is that the main melody theme is
something like CCDEFEDCBBCDCDCD (pauses/lengths ommited).

My question is: Which song am I thinking of?""".

Johann...'.

<#780488> dc:description """Hi. I was on vaccation in Turkey 2002 (during the Soccer World
Champoinship). I'm looking for a song that was played alot in the
radio as well as in restaurants during the time of my stay. I got the
feeling that this song was a radio-'Hit' that summer. The song was
relatively calm and slow with a (I my view) nice melody played on some
kind of flute. I don't think there was a drum beat, and if if there
were drums, they were discrete. The song was in Turkish (I guess). The
singer was a male. The main melody is both singed by the singer and
played by the flute in the middle play. The singer sings the melody
remarkeable 'stronger /more intense' later on in the song. I'm a
little bit uncertain, but mu guess is that the main melody theme is
something like CCDEFEDCBBCDCDCD (pauses/lengths ommited).

Johann...'.

Champoinship). I'm looking for a song that was played alot in the
radio as well as in restaurants during the time of my stay. I got the
feeling that this song was a radio-'Hit' that summer. The song was
relatively calm and slow with a (I my view) nice melody played on some
kind of flute. I don't think there was a drum beat, and if if there
were drums, they were discrete. The song was in Turkish (I guess). The
singer was a male. The main melody is both singed by the singer and
played by the flute in the middle play. The singer sings the melody
remarkeable 'stronger /more intense' later on in the song. I'm a
little bit uncertain, but mu guess is that the main melody theme is
something like CCDEFEDCBBCDCDCD (pauses/lengths ommited).

Champoinship). I'm looking for a song that was played alot in the
radio as well as in restaurants during the time of my stay. I got the
feeling that this song was a radio-'Hit' that summer. The song was
relatively calm and slow with a (I my view) nice melody played on some
kind of flute. I don't think there was a drum beat, and if if there
were drums, they were discrete. The song was in Turkish (I guess). The
singer was a male. The main melody is both singed by the singer and
played by the flute in the middle play. The singer sings the melody
remarkeable 'stronger /more intense' later on in the song. I'm a
little bit uncertain, but mu guess is that the main melody theme is
something like CCDEFEDCBBCDCDCD (pauses/lengths ommited).

feeling that this song was a radio-'Hit' that summer. The song was
relatively calm and slow with a (I my view) nice melody played on some
kind of flute. I don't think there was a drum beat, and if if there
were drums, they were discrete. The song was in Turkish (I guess). The
singer was a male. The main melody is both singed by the singer and
played by the flute in the middle play. The singer sings the melody
remarkeable 'stronger /more intense' later on in the song. I'm a
little bit uncertain, but mu guess is that the main melody theme is
something like CCDEFEDCBBCDCDCD (pauses/lengths ommited).

relatively calm and slow with a (I my view) nice melody played on some
kind of flute. I don't think there was a drum beat, and if if there
were drums, they were discrete. The song was in Turkish (I guess). The
singer was a male. The main melody is both singed by the singer and
played by the flute in the middle play. The singer sings the melody
remarkeable 'stronger /more intense' later on in the song. I'm a

relatively calm and slow with a (I my view) nice melody played on some

were drums, they were discrete. The song was in Turkish (I guess). The
singer was a male. The main melody is both singed by the singer and
played by the flute in the middle play. The singer sings the melody
remarkeable 'stronger /more intense' later on in the song. I'm a

were drums, they were discrete. The song was in Turkish (I guess). The
singer was a male. The main melody is both singed by the singer and
played by the flute in the middle play. The singer sings the melody

Hello. I downloaded a wonderful song months ago, but my computer died

looking for this song for about a week now with no luck. And it also
doesn't help that I don't even remember the song name or who the
artist is.. -_-

The song starts off light and peaceful then slowly builds up with more
music added into the background. Making a magnificent combination of
instruments. There is a lady with a beautiful voice that says
'sunrise' every 10 seconds or so... and 'sunrise' is the only word she
says through the whole song. ( this is the songs theme; du du du du du
a do do do a du du du a do do do 'sunriiiiiise' and repeating so on
and so forth). And the song is trance, dance, and/or electronic. You
the genre. The song is NOT longer than 7 minutes. If that's even any
help.

I know this isn't very much help at all, but I need as much help as I
can get. Even if it's small, it's at least something so that's why I'm
willing to pay so much.""".

relatively calm and slow with a (I my view) nice melody played on some
kind of flute. I don't think there was a drum beat, and if if there
were drums, they were discrete. The song was in Turkish (I guess). The
singer was a male. The main melody is both singed by the singer and
played by the flute in the middle play. The singer sings the melody
remarkeable 'stronger /more intense' later on in the song. I'm a

is called Digital. Comes of the forth coming album The Fragile. This
is Sebado (not sure how to spell that) and the flame. It's Asleep at

some overlapping vocals that make it hard to tell what the lyrics are.

will always ... you I will be ... ... (maybe 'relentless shame'?)If

repeated.)... ... trust me I will make you feel good ... (opening
lyrics again) I will always ... you I will be ... ... (relentless
shame again?)... (opening lyrics) (now there is a kind of guitar
solo.) ... (opening lyrics again) I will take you ... (up? out?) for a
beautiful ... (tour?) ... ... and ... how's if feel to be ... baby ...
... ... don't ... yourself (now the opening lyrics repeat until the
end of the song.) This is as specific as I can get. The song is about
five minutes ten seconds long. I emailed this radio staton but got no

Ms. Cruise contributed a cover of the Elvis tune 'Summer Kisses Winter
Tunes' instead.

I am looking for the lyrics to this song. Bonus tip if you can provide
the guitar chords (no links to sheet music, please).

Just to reiterate, it's NOT the U2 version I'm looking for. Songs with
lyrics about Judas and the line 'surrounding me, going down on me' are
not what I'm looking for. Don't get me wrong -- it's one of my
all-time favorites by U2. It's just not the specific version I'm
seeking.

I have been looking and searching high and wide for an obscure Julee
Cruise song called 'Until the End of the World' with no success. Can
you help out here? It was written as the title song to a Wim Wenders
film of the same name, but in the end, the title song went to U2 and
Ms. Cruise contributed a cover of the Elvis tune 'Summer Kisses Winter
Tunes' instead.

I am looking for the lyrics to this song. Bonus tip if you can provide
the guitar chords (no links to sheet music, please).

Just to reiterate, it's NOT the U2 version I'm looking for. Songs with
lyrics about Judas and the line 'surrounding me, going down on me' are
not what I'm looking for. Don't get me wrong -- it's one of my
