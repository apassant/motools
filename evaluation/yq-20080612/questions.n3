country was great up to the 90's I would say, I dont know what happened, some people say that "Urban Cowboy" messed it all up.
I would say that it went bad with "boot scootin boogie" or maybe billy ray cyrus
that was in 1992, he was the vanilla ice of country music now hes hosting nashville star I believe, that song was horrble back then, but now it just sounds like any other song on the radio today

We had good chemistry between each other while we improvised, but when we started composing a song, it looked like we got lost in our own ideas.

Note that we can play anything from soft classical rock to hardcore metal, as well as jazz & blues.
One guitarist is good at metal, the other is good at rock music, and the keyboardist is good at everything but prefers jazz & blues or alternative rock.
The guitarists are good at playing jazz & blues, but are better in metal and rock.

There's a song that's inside of my soul
It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again
I'm awake in the infinite cold
But You sing to me over and over and over again

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands
and pray to be only Yours
I pray to be only Yours
I know now you're my only hope

Sing to me the song of the stars
Of Your galaxy dancing and laughing
and laughing again
When it feels like my dreams are so far
Sing to me of the plans that You have for me over again

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray
To be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I know now you're my only hope

I give You my destiny
I'm giving You all of me
I want Your symphony
Singing in all that I am
At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back

I'm just beginning to play the violin, but I'm running into some problems with my fingernails on my left hand.

As is well known, shortened fingernails are the way to go. But for some reason no matter how much I clip them, the nails on my hand are still not short enough! I think I even clipped them a little too much because too much of the finger below the nail is exposed.

Even with all the whites of the nails clipped off, the padding on my fingertips do not extend past my fingernail enough. I have provided some images to make what I'm trying to describe more clear.

http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/2493/fingerry1.jpg

Does anyone know what I need to do to make the padding of my fingertips extend past my shortened fingernails?

P.S. This problem also plagued me during my piano studies, as no matter how much I clipped my nails you could hear them click click clicking on the piano.
Just to clarify, even clipped all the way when I tap on a hard surface my fingers mostly vertically I can still hear the nails. Seems the padding of my fingertips is not big enough  or something.
But that's only when I'm tapping perfectly vertically... If I tap about 30 degrees to the side then my nails don't contact the surface. Is this okay? I had always thought playing the violin requires fingers to be pressing on the strings almost vertically.

Solo por cosas del amor, problemas entre tu y yo
que culpa tuvo ese nino, de nuestra mala relacion
dices que a la pobresa no se trae una creatura a pasar dolor
que estas arrenpetida y que no quieres ser la madre de lo que es un error

Eso que has cometido no lo perdona Dios
Eso que has cometido es pecado ante Dios

Por tu poca ignorancia me dan ganas de llorar

But now I'm starting to think it's just a meaningless label.
A fellow user once said that Sonic Youth didn't seem heavy enough to be Alternative. Another user earlier today called Disturbed and Metallica Alternative Rock. These days, when people ask for Alternative bands, they often get bands like Fall Out Boy.

From this, one can tell that different people have very different views as to what Alternative Music really is.

Let your followers know their lives have been sold

I've been thinking a lot about cover songs -- when a band records/performs a song that was originally written/performed by someone else.  In particular, what cover songs do you know where the COVER version is more well-known than the original.

Some examples:
- Sh-boom:  originally recorded by the Chords, but better known in its version by the Crew Cuts (both from 1954, I think??)
- When a Man Loves a Woman:  by Percy Sledge (1966), but (arguably) better known today in the remake by Michael Bolton (1991)
- Red Rubber Ball:  written by Paul Simon, but recorded by The Cyrkle in 1966.  Interestingly, Simon and Garfunkel made a live recording of this song (on the "Simon and Garfunkel: Old Friends" collection)...is THIS a cover?  Did Paul Simon "cover" his own song?

If anyone knows of any other songs in this category, I'd love to hear them!
Katydint -- Oh no!  Not BETTER.  I despise Michael Bolton.  But I'm suggesting that his recording might be more WELL-KNOWN than Sledge.  (I have no statistics to back that up, other than that I've heard Bolton's version on the radio much more often...)

I had this really odd idea this morning that it might be fun to do this as a 'musical' and I realized it would be a lot of work... We've only got two or three days to work on this, but I thought it might be fun to do a voice over for Bohemian Rhapsody which has a pretty good variety of paces for a good ripping argument... 

Question is, where could I find a good quality version of the song that isn't a "Karaoke Toy Electric Piano" version but that also doesn't have any vocals... I want control over the pausing which may not match the original and I don't want to pause and have Freddie singing away...

Thanks...
Incidentally, I am open to 'download' options since this is an educational project and I am relatively sure that this is covered by 'fair use' (and I'm not even in America anyhow).

I'd check the torrents but I don't really know where to start... 

Should I be looking at Karaoke versions? Are there Karaoke versions that feature higher quality than others?

yeah, I saw that link too... it's actually a broken link... #1 on the list from google. yay.

<#1213253206> dc:description """Ok, this one is tough.  It was on the grocery store Muzak.  It has a slow verse, with little or no drums, and an upbeat chorus that has drums.  

It sounds like late 70s or early 80s.  The chorus lyrics I can hardly remember but they repeat a few lines, something first, then something about "you always knew me the best" or similar.

It sounds like a sort of average early 80s light rock style band a-la Ambrosia, Player, Boz Skaggs, something along those lines.  Throw out anything you can think of please, it's driving me nuts.
Ro-Vale, how the HELL did you figure it out?  The details I gave were totally wrong, and the lines weren't even from the chorus?  WOW!

Well, thanks, it's the right song.
Oh, no, it's not the right song, but it triggered the right song in my head.  It was very close.  The song I'm thinking of should be easier to find, I was able to write out the melody and now I'll just post it up and see who recognises it.

Track Five:

Baby don't you worry
I'm afraid to put my soul to rest
...
There's a place...
Which I truly do believe
There's a space
That's where we'll...
And we'll leave our destinations 
But my soul remains

How does it feel... nothing is real

Track 5:

If you found a way
Could you show me a sign
Could you hold the door
And let me run through 
To a better place
That let's my mind
Helps my mind choose
I have to count on you
...

Track 6:

We made a sensation
We are the ones
Then we made a commitment
Always to ride clean in the race
...
We're moving closer to our fate
Keeping coming on and up...
I think there is magic that I see
Let's take it from here and up

Track 7
All I got from this was:

Say my name like you did before
...
You don't know what love is
