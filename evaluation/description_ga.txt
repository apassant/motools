 There was a website at least a few years ago that featured lessons on    songwriting and composing from top songwriters and producers including    (but not limited to) Rodney Jerkins and Max Martin.  What was the name    of this site?  Is it possible to get some of the content from the    site?  Thanks in advance!  
 There was an ad campaign on ESPN a couple of years ago during either    the women&#39;s NCAA basketball season, or the WNBA season.  They played a    very popular song from the 1970s in the background of one of their    ads.  It was a disco-ish song, and in the same neighborhood as Sister    Sledge&#39;s &quot;We Are Family.&quot;  I remember thinking to myself, &quot;I really    like that song.  I need to download it.&quot;  But I forgot to write it    down, and now I&#39;ve forgotten the title.  Female singers.  Upbeat.  I    have no recollection of lyrics or melody.  Can someone help me figure    out the title of this song and the group that sang it?

 there is a techno song that i heard on the radio recently that i    really liked. I figured that i could find it by jotting down a couple    of lines from it. When i got home and searched, however, google drew a    blank. The beginning of the chorus goes something like: &quot;all the    people in this place from coast to coast, put your best foot forward    and rock the house&quot; What is the artist (DJ) and title of this song?  
 I heard this song about 12 years ago on an audio cassette tape.  The   woman who had put the tape together said that it was Reba McIntyre, I   think, but I haven&#39;t been able to confirm that.  The lyrics went   something like this - they were beautiful and told the story of a   little girl who had had a doll when she was young, and was now a young   mother raising a child:       When I was young I had dolls some could walk some could talk    Others would wet when I&#39;d lie &#39;em down        But you, you&#39;re like no doll  
 There was a song on the radio about 16 years ago that was written as a    daughter singing to her dad. The song started with what sounded like a    little girl singing, then it was a teen girl singing and it ended with    a woman    singing... It was like you listened to the little girl grow up    lyrically and vocally. It seems that I remember it being a slower    song. I would love to have the information on this song to use it for    a father/daughter dance at my wedding.        Thanks for your help!  
 I&#39;m looking for the lyrics of few songs of the British folk group of   early seventies The Pentangle.

 I need sheet music for &quot;God Only Knows&quot; by the Beach Boys (from &quot;Pet    Sounds,&quot; of course) for a STRING QUARTET.        Unfortunately, it needs to be for a string quartet specifically (ie,    not a guitar tab).  I don&#39;t really know anything about    music, but i will try to contact the quartet in question if anyone    would like clarifications on what does/doesn&#39;t qualify.        An internet address where I can order it is preferable, but any music    store that will ship it or whatever is fine.  Not sure about an offer    to personally transcribe the sheet music, since I don&#39;t really know    what the going rate for such a thing would be.

 &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; and &quot;Angels We Have Heard On High&quot; sound very very    similar to me. ( I am not a trained musician)  Are they    historically/musically related in anyway?  Or is the similar melody    just a product of chance?

 I downloaded a version of the old Hoagy Carmichael-Frank Loesser tune   &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;  from iTunes.The Artist and Albums are both listed as   &quot;Rock and Roll Classics&quot; which is not helpful at all. The copyright is   held by Crownstar Records and the cover art is an image of an LP with   a red label saying &quot; Crown Records&quot;.   The male singer is accompanied by strings, horns, piano, a rhythm   section and backup singers and it sounds like it was from the early to   mid Sixties. The arrangment is reminiscent of Smokey Robinson&#39;s &quot; Ooh   Baby Baby&quot; The vocalist is a  tenor and sounds a bit like Smokey or   Johnny Mathis but without so much falsetto.   Can anybody identify it? (It&#39;s not the Cleftones)

Thank you!  
 I found a song somebody had recorded off the radio. At the end of the   song the female D.J. comes on and says &quot;Boston&#39;s real alternative 1017   FNX. There you go, as promised brand new song from Nine Inch Nails. It   is called Digital. Comes of the forth coming album The Fragile. This   is Sebado (not sure how to spell that) and the flame. It&#39;s Asleep at   the Wheel. FNX&quot; However this song is not a Nine Inch Nails song. The   song is kind of techno industrial with electroinc drums and synth and   some overlapping vocals that make it hard to tell what the lyrics are.   This is what I can gather (... = lyrics I can not make out.): ... I   will always ... you I will be ... ... (maybe &quot;relentless shame&quot;?)If   you want to leave ... ... (here the opening unintelligable words are   repeated.)... ... trust me I will make you feel good ... (opening   lyrics again) I will always ... you I will be ... ... (relentless   shame again?)... (opening lyrics) (now there is a kind of guitar   solo.) ... (opening lyrics again) I will take you ... (up? out?) for a   beautiful ... (tour?) ... ... and ... how&#39;s if feel to be ... baby ...   ... ... don&#39;t ... yourself (now the opening lyrics repeat until the   end of the song.) This is as specific as I can get. The song is about   five minutes ten seconds long. I emailed this radio staton but got no   reply. I can email the song if need be. Who is this!?! I&#39;ve been   searching for over a year!  
 I am looking for a song written in the 80s, the mid 80s I think.  The   genre is pop/rock, or soft rock, and the artist sounds a bit like Mike   and the Mechanics.  I have some of the lyrics in my head, and here   they are:       -Taking in, taking in again, you said I&#39;m the only one but we can be   just friends...   -And if you say....I don&#39;t believe it... And if you....I don&#39;t believe it...

 I am looking for the name of the artist, song and album (and where I can buy    it) of a particular song.  The song is in the electronica / &quot;chill    out&quot; genre, slightly hip hop.  Most of the words are in french except   for the words &quot;long term focus&quot; which are repeated in english quite a   bit.  The song was playing in the lobby of The Shore Club Hotel on   Monday, November 14th around 4:!5 in the afternoon.  
 The name of a rock song and the group that performed it.  Song    received a lot of air play somewhere between &#39;93 and &#39;95.

 Need help looking for a trance song.?    Hello. I downloaded a wonderful song months ago, but my computer died   and I lost all my music. I&#39;ve gotten almost everything, but I&#39;ve been   looking for this song for about a week now with no luck. And it also   doesn&#39;t help that I don&#39;t even remember the song name or who the   artist is.. -_-       The song starts off light and peaceful then slowly builds up with more   music added into the background. Making a magnificent combination of   instruments. There is a lady with a beautiful voice that says   &quot;sunrise&quot; every 10 seconds or so... and &quot;sunrise&quot; is the only word she   says through the whole song. ( this is the songs theme; du du du du du   a do do do a du du du a do do do &#39;sunriiiiiise&#39; and repeating so on   and so forth). And the song is trance, dance, and/or electronic. You   the genre. The song is NOT longer than 7 minutes. If that&#39;s even any   help.       I know this isn&#39;t very much help at all, but I need as much help as I   can get. Even if it&#39;s small, it&#39;s at least something so that&#39;s why I&#39;m   willing to pay so much.  
 I would like a list of places to go watch freestyle rap competitions   (freestyle performances/jams are ok too, but competitions would be   better) in the northeast.  I live in Boston, MA.  So the closer the   better.  I would go as far as New York City.  I would like to get the   venue name and time of performance.       I already got a short list of places from this New York Times article   below.  Please exclude those on the list.  Thank you!

 There are all sorts of great/innovative DJs out there today like   Tiesto and Sasha. But what will electronic music sound like 10 or 20   years from now? It&#39;s such a new sort of music (relatively) that it&#39;s   hard to know where it&#39;s heading. I did some poking around online - but   I couldn&#39;t find ANY opinions about this! What do you think? I look   forward to reading your insights.  
 I am trying to find a comprehensive list of live music    venues/promoters in England that currently put on rock n roll bands.        The aim is to have a downloadable Excel compatible file that has    several columns containing venue information.  For example, name of    venue, address, contact name and telephone number, email, website,    etc.        I realise that not every venue will have a website or email address    but I would still like them to be included in the results.        I would like the results in some kind of geographical order, for    instance, it could be ordered by region, i.e. Manchester in the North    West.        I found this website which lists the largest cities in the UK:      
 Hi. I was on vaccation in Turkey 2002 (during the Soccer World   Champoinship). I&#39;m looking for a song that was played alot in the   radio as well as in restaurants during the time of my stay. I got the   feeling that this song was a radio-&quot;Hit&quot; that summer. The song was   relatively calm and slow with a (I my view) nice melody played on some   kind of flute. I don&#39;t think there was a drum beat, and if if there   were drums, they were discrete. The song was in Turkish (I guess). The   singer was a male. The main melody is both singed by the singer and   played by the flute in the middle play. The singer sings the melody   remarkeable &quot;stronger /more intense&quot; later on in the song. I&#39;m a   little bit uncertain, but mu guess is that the main melody theme is   something like CCDEFEDCBBCDCDCD (pauses/lengths ommited).       My question is: Which song am I thinking of?  
 I have had this fragmented song stuck in my head for several years now   and I want to find out the actual song name.

 I&#39;m looking for sources that can tell me about new songs, rumored   songs and upcoming songs.       I&#39;d like to know about songs before they hit the radios and as soon as   it&#39;s released.  A few sources I know about include checking the   following sites and blogs:       music.aol.com/songs/newsongs    perezhilton.com        These sites don&#39;t always have the latest and sometimes are even a week   late.  I&#39;d like a list of other sources I can look through to find out   about new songs/albums/singles as soon as they&#39;re announced/rumored.  
 I am trying to set up a charity auction on eBay benefitting &quot;Journey   for the Cure Foundation&quot; - The Journey for the Cure Foundation proudly   supports the MS Society, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society and St. Judes   Children Hospital. They specfically fund research to find cures for   these associated diseases. Proudly, 100% of their financing goes   directly to find the cure and they have no paid staff or employees.   This auction would be for my collection of Cure albums (over 50) in a   LOT auction.  100% of the proceeds would go to Journey for the Cure   Foundation through MissionFish (the eBay Charitable donations   organizers for such events).  My question:  Does anyone know how to   get in touch with either Geffen Records (and WHO at Geffen to contact   about this) and/or Robert Smith of the Cure to obtain personal   Autographs for/on my collection or donations of merchandise to add to   this auction. Until I have attempted to gather more items, the auction   will not take place.  Any voluntary help is appreciated.  
 I&#39;m trying to find out the name of this obscure early 80&#39;s pop band,   and album names.  They were   from Ohio.  They were signed to Capitol records, and I think they put    out 1, maybe 2 albums.  The group consisted of 3 members, 2 of whom    were brothers.  Thank you.  
 I was given a copy of the album in question (on tape; with no info) in   the late 80&#39;s, while I was pre-teen. I never discovered any   information about the album or artist; although, I do recall hearing   some of the music on European TVs (series, news spots, etc.) around   the same period.       Only clues I can offer:        - I am 99% certain that the artist is European (most likely German).        - The album started with a German speaking announcer introducing   &quot;Johann ???&quot; (I think) to a cheering crowed: &quot;Damen und Herren,   Johann...&quot;.       - Tones / Sounds: While I don&#39;t recall any particular piece of music   from the tape (album); I do, however, distinctively recall the tones /   sounds. For instance, the sound heard in the background on track 11 of   Prodigy&#39;s Music for Jilted Generation (1:31 ? 37 into the song), and   several others bits on this particular track (are likely the same   synthesizer).       I require Artist and Album information.        Thanks,        Johans  
 During the late 70&#39;s-early 80&#39;s, there was playing a great country   song with lyrics that included, &quot;...t-r-o-u-b-l-e, well I think that   old trouble&#39;s done and got the best of me...&quot; This is not the song by   the same title by Elvis or the one by Travis Tritt.  
 Hello,        I am interested in taking Indian classical music lessons specifically    on the bamboo flute (also called bansuri).  I have searched far and    wide for teachers in the Washington D.C., Maryland, or Northern    Virginia area but have not come up with anything.  I have found a    bunch of vocal, tabla (drums), and sitar teachers, as well as other    flute teachers, but not Indian classical or bansuri.  Maybe there is a    search string I haven&#39;t thought of -- if anybody can find me an actual    teacher, I would be much obliged.  I am at the point where even if I    had to drive 2 hours or so away on a weekend morning, I would do it,    so please keep that in mind if it comes down to it!  Thanks in    advance.

 I heard this great, Christian song tonight on the radio, and I haven&#39;t   been able to track it down. It&#39;s a woman artist, the song is sort of   R&amp;B. Some of the lyrics as I remember them include &quot;I want to know how   are things between us&quot; and &quot;what&#39;s new since we last spoke.&quot; Please   advise!

 I was shopping at a Sephora store today and heard a great song.  I&#39;ve    heard it somewhere before, but can&#39;t place it.  The song starts with    someone whistling the melody of the hook.  The lyrics contain a line    similar to &quot;would you get along with a guy like me&quot;, or possibly,   &quot;...someone like me&quot; .  The band is   possibly British.  It&#39;s a generally upbeat and happy-feeling song. I&#39;m    almost certain it&#39;s a new-ish release.  Any idea who the band is and    the song title?  
 I&#39;ve been searching for this specific version of O Holy Night for   years. All I know about it is that it was recorded off the radio in   Winnipeg, MB, Canada during the early 90&#39;s. I have a garbled recording   off of an old cassette tape that I put online.     
 I have been looking for a song that I heard on vacation in Greece in    the spring of 2000.  I have been unable to find the song as I don&#39;t    recall the title or singer.  The song was played almost everywhere I    went.  I must have heard it 100 times.  The only information I have is    this:        Female Greek language singer    In the top ten charts in the Spring of 2000    Wasn&#39;t an electronic song, rather it was more like a traditional greek pop song.        I would like to find out the song title.  Could you find a Greek chart    hits for the spring of 2000?  Perhaps that way I could find the    song/artist on the list.        Thank you so much,    Katy W.  
 I&#39;m looking for a song.        In the Thomas Crown Affair movie (the 1999 version), Pierce Brosnan    and Rene Russo dance to a sexy tune played by a band. According to the    movie&#39;s ending credits, and some online references, the song is called    &quot;Cumenco.&quot; It was performed by the &quot;Cumenco All-Stars,&quot; was written by    Raf S. Astor and Eddie Bobe, and was produced by Todd Barkan and Jim    Dunbar.        This song is *not* on the movie&#39;s soundtrack CD, and is not on iTunes.    In fact, it seems to be impossible to find.        If you can find a copy of the song that I can buy online, or download,    for $50 or less, you have answered my question.  
 I&#39;m looking for a karaoke/instrumental version of &quot;Superman&#39;s Song&quot;,    by Crash Test Dummies.  Is there any hope?  I wasn&#39;t easily able to   find a downloadable version, but I was thinking solutions might   include services that convert songs, etc.  Thanks!  
 I am looking for a south african rap video featuring a well-dressed    african rapping to classical piano music - It appeared a few weeks ago    in a BBC program about SA music from Miriam Makeba to Kwaito    I will consider the question answered with a sound bite from for example amazon  
 It happened again.  Willis Alan Ramsey played a concert earlier this   month and I found out about it after the event.  I read about it on   Wikipedia of all places.  I guess if I&#39;m looking for a specific answer   it is this:  How  do I get a hold of the new album that Willis has   finished (it was produced by Jamie Oldaker)?  And where and when is   Willis playing in the next year?  
 I am trying to find a recording of Carol Channing singing, &quot;Hello,    Lyndon&quot; (a take off on the song, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;) which she sang at    the 1963 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City. If anybody    can find me either an Mp3 of it, or a CD on which it exists, or any    other form in which I can purchase something and hear the original    version (not the re-recorded versions done by several artists since)    that would be awesome!  
 Ok guys in the move &quot;50 first dates&quot;, there&#39;s a reggae song that plays    at about 11 minutes and 30 seconds into the movie, and if i can make    it out correctly the singer sings something that sounds like &quot;it is    you oh yeaaah&quot;, now what i wanna know is what&#39;s the artist&#39;s name and    what the song nameis...and that&#39;s about it, thank you :-)  
 The last 2 times I was in Canada I saw a music video in rotation of a   white french speaking rapper. He was great and I dont speak french. He   had a almost shaved head and a square face. He may have been from   France...who is he?  
 Still looking for a great tearjerking song classic country song from   the early to mid-eighties that me and my sister still remember and   can&#39;t pinpoint. Lyrics I remember are &quot;...forget me not, regret me not   my darling, I&#39;ll be true as long as these flowers stay true blue...and   if our love should ever die..&quot; The lyrics implying that and the lover   from the song kept replacing faded flowers in order not to have to   face that his loved one would never return to him. Artist and title   please. Album, chart placement, and songwriter would be great. This is   not the song by Wariner. Thanks!  
 Hello,         I have been looking and searching high and wide for an obscure Julee   Cruise song called &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; with no success. Can   you help out here? It was written as the title song to a Wim Wenders   film of the same name, but in the end, the title song went to U2 and   Ms. Cruise contributed a cover of the Elvis tune &quot;Summer Kisses Winter   Tunes&quot; instead.       I am looking for the lyrics to this song. Bonus tip if you can provide   the guitar chords (no links to sheet music, please).       Just to reiterate, it&#39;s NOT the U2 version I&#39;m looking for. Songs with   lyrics about Judas and the line &quot;surrounding me, going down on me&quot; are   not what I&#39;m looking for. Don&#39;t get me wrong -- it&#39;s one of my   all-time favorites by U2.

 Ok I heard a song today on a Seattle radio station between   7:30-8:15pm. It sounded like Coldplay a lot and had the words   Nashville and California in it I think. It was a song played during   the John Tesh show on this station and immediately after the song John   Tesh came on to talk. Does anyone have ANY clue what song that was? I   have never heard it before so I assume it was new. The stations I was   listening to and switching between were 101.5, 103.7, 96.5, and 106.9.   HELP!

 Hi,        I have a collection, between me and my wife, of over 500 CD&#39;s.. some   of which we have ripped at different quality levels on our computers,   some are on external USB drives and some are on DVD&#39;s when we got   those DVD writers.       We also have a few iPods and are also planning to get the new 8gb Nano   and compile what we play the most on to that one for both of us.       I&#39;m not sure how do I go about doing this without losing my data or   getting too much of it onto the smaller Nano iPod&#39;s.       I need advice as to how to manage them with the best software out   there.. Cost isn&#39;t an issue if I&#39;ll lose the headache after spending   the money.       We have four computers that store our music, mostly under iTunes,   three external USB HD&#39;s and a collection of DVD&#39;s I don&#39;t know how   many are those and of course the original roughly 500 music CD&#39;s.       Oh yeah, we also now download from allmymp3.com which is more   convenient for the titles they carry.       HELP! :-)        -Mao

 Hello, my 16-year-old son has recently declared that he loves jazz (of    all things!) ? both playing saxophone and listening to classic ?bop?    songs. I have to admit ? I don?t know anything about jazz, and I    didn?t even know what bop was until I looked it up, but I would love    to get him some jazz CDs for his birthday. If I were to purchase the 5    best ?bop? CDs of all time, what should I get? My search for bop    artists turned up John Coltrane and Miles Davis ? does that sound like    a good way to go? I?m excited that my son is into this, and who knows,    maybe I can learn to like Jazz too! Thanks!  
 Third Eye Blind is a major label band (they were on Elektra). The title    of their latest album Out of the Vein was originally going to be    called Crystal Baller. There are rumors that the album was actually    released in Japan under this name for a very short time before they    rereleased it under the Out of the Vein title, well before the US    release was actually out.        1. Is this true? If it is, read the next questions.        2. What is the catalog number of the Japanese Crystal Baller release?        3. Is there a place where I can buy this release from?        4.

 I was at a club the other night and saw an amazing  concert video of   two drummers. It was two drummers both on risers playing a jam of many   diffrent rock songs. There was some Aerosmith, and Audioslave (I   think). There was also some sort of grey or silver logo in the back.   The partial clip was at least 5 minutes long. Does anyone know what   video this was?

 Please listen to the following 4 minute splice of a song found on a    mix that I downloaded from Kazaa....the entire mp3 file is called    &quot;Classic Alternative Dance Mix&quot; by Jimmy V (yes, very creative, I    know).        I googled the artist and mix name but to no avail.  I have most of the    full lenght version of the songs featured on this 46 minute classic    alternative mix but I really really love this particular 4 min song    that was mixed in.

 I&#39;m looking for the title and artist of a mid-to-late 80&#39;s rock/pop   song I remember from my childhood.  At one time I had it on tape but   simply cannot locate it despite my best efforts.  All I can remember   are a few lyrical phrases, which may not even be accurate, so here   goes:       - You know I&#39;ve got this feeling    - You and me, we&#39;ve got a long long way to go    - I&#39;m standin&#39; on the edge of love (part of chorus)        I&#39;ve done some extensive Googling with some matching, but have reach   the conclusion that some of the words may not be exactly right.  Here   are the songs I&#39;ve eliminated so far:       McFadden &amp; Whitehead - Ain&#39;t No Stoppin&#39; Us Now    Phil Collins - Long Long Way To Go    Hanne Boel - Standing on the Edge of Love    BB King - Standing On The Edge    Tinsley Ellis - Standing On The Edge Of Love

 What would be the best solution to capture the sound of a high school   marching band on the field at a live performance?  The band is large   and spread out all over the football field.       The primary attribute one would need to consider is that the sound is   very dispersed, but it all comes from less than 180 degrees in front   of where the microphone would be located.       I&#39;m looking for an ideal microphone type, best suited for that job.        Also, where would be an ideal location to place the mics?  High, low,   middle, far from the band, close to the band?       Also, would I need more than 2?        Thanks!!!  
 What&#39;s the name and artist of the dance remix of a theme from the Overture to    Rocky 2 (not the &quot;famous&quot; Rocky theme) I heard on a radio station in    Athens this June, and what CD album is it featured on  
 Back in 2000 my brother introduced me to a band called &quot;Lokomotiv&quot;   here in the USA by e-mailing me an MP3 of theirs. I&#39;ve done some   research and found that they were supposed to come out with the album   &quot;What&#39;s Your Good Luck?&quot; in 2000 but I&#39;m not sure if that ever   actually happened. I have their Advance CD from Mammouth Records   (which I found on eBay after years of searching) but I&#39;d like to know   if it was ever officially released, and if not, why?       Also, after more research, I found out that the band is originally    from Norway under the name &quot;Locomotives&quot; and have been making CD&#39;s there    since around the mid-1990&#39;s. I really like their music and would like    to get their albums, but I don&#39;t know where to buy them, how    many they came out with, etc. All I know is what I&#39;ve found at

 There was an ad campaign on ESPN a couple of years ago during either    the women&#39;s NCAA basketball season, or the WNBA season.  They played a    very popular song from the 1970s in the background of one of their    ads.  It was a disco-ish song, and in the same neighborhood as Sister    Sledge&#39;s &quot;We Are Family.&quot;  I remember thinking to myself, &quot;I really    like that song.  I need to download it.&quot;  But I forgot to write it    down, and now I&#39;ve forgotten the title.  Female singers.  Upbeat.  I    have no recollection of lyrics or melody.  Can someone help me figure    out the title of this song and the group that sang it?

 there is a techno song that i heard on the radio recently that i    really liked. I figured that i could find it by jotting down a couple    of lines from it.

 I heard this song about 12 years ago on an audio cassette tape.  The   woman who had put the tape together said that it was Reba McIntyre, I   think, but I haven&#39;t been able to confirm that.  The lyrics went   something like this - they were beautiful and told the story of a   little girl who had had a doll when she was young, and was now a young   mother raising a child:       When I was young I had dolls some could walk some could talk    Others would wet when I&#39;d lie &#39;em down        But you, you&#39;re like no doll  
 There was a song on the radio about 16 years ago that was written as a    daughter singing to her dad. The song started with what sounded like a    little girl singing, then it was a teen girl singing and it ended with    a woman    singing... It was like you listened to the little girl grow up    lyrically and vocally. It seems that I remember it being a slower    song. I would love to have the information on this song to use it for    a father/daughter dance at my wedding.        Thanks for your help!

 I need sheet music for &quot;God Only Knows&quot; by the Beach Boys (from &quot;Pet    Sounds,&quot; of course) for a STRING QUARTET.        Unfortunately, it needs to be for a string quartet specifically (ie,    not a guitar tab).  I don&#39;t really know anything about    music, but i will try to contact the quartet in question if anyone    would like clarifications on what does/doesn&#39;t qualify.        An internet address where I can order it is preferable, but any music    store that will ship it or whatever is fine.  Not sure about an offer    to personally transcribe the sheet music, since I don&#39;t really know    what the going rate for such a thing would be.

 I downloaded a version of the old Hoagy Carmichael-Frank Loesser tune   &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;  from iTunes.The Artist and Albums are both listed as   &quot;Rock and Roll Classics&quot; which is not helpful at all. The copyright is   held by Crownstar Records and the cover art is an image of an LP with   a red label saying &quot; Crown Records&quot;.   The male singer is accompanied by strings, horns, piano, a rhythm   section and backup singers and it sounds like it was from the early to   mid Sixties. The arrangment is reminiscent of Smokey Robinson&#39;s &quot; Ooh   Baby Baby&quot; The vocalist is a  tenor and sounds a bit like Smokey or   Johnny Mathis but without so much falsetto.   Can anybody identify it? (It&#39;s not the Cleftones)

 I found a song somebody had recorded off the radio. At the end of the   song the female D.J. comes on and says &quot;Boston&#39;s real alternative 1017   FNX. There you go, as promised brand new song from Nine Inch Nails. It   is called Digital. Comes of the forth coming album The Fragile. This   is Sebado (not sure how to spell that) and the flame. It&#39;s Asleep at   the Wheel. FNX&quot; However this song is not a Nine Inch Nails song. The   song is kind of techno industrial with electroinc drums and synth and   some overlapping vocals that make it hard to tell what the lyrics are.   This is what I can gather (... = lyrics I can not make out.): ... I   will always ... you I will be ... ... (maybe &quot;relentless shame&quot;?)If   you want to leave ... ... (here the opening unintelligable words are   repeated.)... ... trust me I will make you feel good ... (opening   lyrics again) I will always ... you I will be ... ... (relentless   shame again?)... (opening lyrics) (now there is a kind of guitar   solo.) ... (opening lyrics again) I will take you ... (up? out?) for a   beautiful ... (tour?) ... ... and ... how&#39;s if feel to be ... baby ...   ... ... don&#39;t ... yourself (now the opening lyrics repeat until the   end of the song.) This is as specific as I can get. The song is about   five minutes ten seconds long. I emailed this radio staton but got no   reply. I can email the song if need be. Who is this!?! I&#39;ve been   searching for over a year!  
 I am looking for a song written in the 80s, the mid 80s I think.  The   genre is pop/rock, or soft rock, and the artist sounds a bit like Mike   and the Mechanics.  I have some of the lyrics in my head, and here   they are:       -Taking in, taking in again, you said I&#39;m the only one but we can be   just friends...   -And if you say....I don&#39;t believe it... And if you....I don&#39;t believe it...

 Need help looking for a trance song.?    Hello. I downloaded a wonderful song months ago, but my computer died   and I lost all my music. I&#39;ve gotten almost everything, but I&#39;ve been   looking for this song for about a week now with no luck. And it also   doesn&#39;t help that I don&#39;t even remember the song name or who the   artist is.. -_-       The song starts off light and peaceful then slowly builds up with more   music added into the background. Making a magnificent combination of   instruments. There is a lady with a beautiful voice that says   &quot;sunrise&quot; every 10 seconds or so... and &quot;sunrise&quot; is the only word she   says through the whole song. ( this is the songs theme; du du du du du   a do do do a du du du a do do do &#39;sunriiiiiise&#39; and repeating so on   and so forth). And the song is trance, dance, and/or electronic. You   the genre. The song is NOT longer than 7 minutes. If that&#39;s even any   help.       I know this isn&#39;t very much help at all, but I need as much help as I   can get. Even if it&#39;s small, it&#39;s at least something so that&#39;s why I&#39;m   willing to pay so much.  
 I would like a list of places to go watch freestyle rap competitions   (freestyle performances/jams are ok too, but competitions would be   better) in the northeast.  I live in Boston, MA.  So the closer the   better.  I would go as far as New York City.  I would like to get the   venue name and time of performance.       I already got a short list of places from this New York Times article   below.  Please exclude those on the list.  Thank you!

 I learnt a nonsense song from my grandmother (born 1890 in Midlands)   Does anyone know anything about it?  Could the lyrics be Romani?  Is   it the same as one in Cecil Sharp&quot;s Appalachian Folk Songbook?  Here   goes..

 There are all sorts of great/innovative DJs out there today like   Tiesto and Sasha. But what will electronic music sound like 10 or 20   years from now? It&#39;s such a new sort of music (relatively) that it&#39;s   hard to know where it&#39;s heading. I did some poking around online - but   I couldn&#39;t find ANY opinions about this! What do you think? I look   forward to reading your insights.  
 I am trying to find a comprehensive list of live music    venues/promoters in England that currently put on rock n roll bands.        The aim is to have a downloadable Excel compatible file that has    several columns containing venue information.  For example, name of    venue, address, contact name and telephone number, email, website,    etc.        I realise that not every venue will have a website or email address    but I would still like them to be included in the results.        I would like the results in some kind of geographical order, for    instance, it could be ordered by region, i.e. Manchester in the North    West.        I found this website which lists the largest cities in the UK:      
 Hi. I was on vaccation in Turkey 2002 (during the Soccer World   Champoinship). I&#39;m looking for a song that was played alot in the   radio as well as in restaurants during the time of my stay. I got the   feeling that this song was a radio-&quot;Hit&quot; that summer. The song was   relatively calm and slow with a (I my view) nice melody played on some   kind of flute. I don&#39;t think there was a drum beat, and if if there   were drums, they were discrete. The song was in Turkish (I guess). The   singer was a male. The main melody is both singed by the singer and   played by the flute in the middle play. The singer sings the melody   remarkeable &quot;stronger /more intense&quot; later on in the song. I&#39;m a   little bit uncertain, but mu guess is that the main melody theme is   something like CCDEFEDCBBCDCDCD (pauses/lengths ommited).       My question is: Which song am I thinking of?  
 I have had this fragmented song stuck in my head for several years now   and I want to find out the actual song name. The song is at least five   years old and popular enough to have been played on mainstream radio   once or twice in Australia. I have the opening part of the song but   that is all, the link is     
 I am trying to buy the audio CD &quot;A Pizza the size of the Sun&quot; and   cannot find it offered at any store.  I would like to locate a copy   for purchase.

 I&#39;m looking for sources that can tell me about new songs, rumored   songs and upcoming songs.       I&#39;d like to know about songs before they hit the radios and as soon as   it&#39;s released.  A few sources I know about include checking the   following sites and blogs:       music.aol.com/songs/newsongs    perezhilton.com        These sites don&#39;t always have the latest and sometimes are even a week   late.  I&#39;d like a list of other sources I can look through to find out   about new songs/albums/singles as soon as they&#39;re announced/rumored.  
 I am trying to set up a charity auction on eBay benefitting &quot;Journey   for the Cure Foundation&quot; - The Journey for the Cure Foundation proudly   supports the MS Society, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society and St. Judes   Children Hospital. They specfically fund research to find cures for   these associated diseases. Proudly, 100% of their financing goes   directly to find the cure and they have no paid staff or employees.   This auction would be for my collection of Cure albums (over 50) in a   LOT auction.  100% of the proceeds would go to Journey for the Cure   Foundation through MissionFish (the eBay Charitable donations   organizers for such events).  My question:  Does anyone know how to   get in touch with either Geffen Records (and WHO at Geffen to contact   about this) and/or Robert Smith of the Cure to obtain personal   Autographs for/on my collection or donations of merchandise to add to   this auction. Until I have attempted to gather more items, the auction   will not take place.  Any voluntary help is appreciated.  
 I&#39;m trying to find out the name of this obscure early 80&#39;s pop band,   and album names.  They were   from Ohio.  They were signed to Capitol records, and I think they put    out 1, maybe 2 albums.  The group consisted of 3 members, 2 of whom    were brothers.  Thank you.  
 I was given a copy of the album in question (on tape; with no info) in   the late 80&#39;s, while I was pre-teen. I never discovered any   information about the album or artist; although, I do recall hearing   some of the music on European TVs (series, news spots, etc.) around   the same period.       Only clues I can offer:        - I am 99% certain that the artist is European (most likely German).        - The album started with a German speaking announcer introducing   &quot;Johann ???&quot; (I think) to a cheering crowed: &quot;Damen und Herren,   Johann...&quot;.       - Tones / Sounds: While I don&#39;t recall any particular piece of music   from the tape (album); I do, however, distinctively recall the tones /   sounds. For instance, the sound heard in the background on track 11 of   Prodigy&#39;s Music for Jilted Generation (1:31 ? 37 into the song), and   several others bits on this particular track (are likely the same   synthesizer).       I require Artist and Album information.        Thanks,        Johans  
 During the late 70&#39;s-early 80&#39;s, there was playing a great country   song with lyrics that included, &quot;...t-r-o-u-b-l-e, well I think that   old trouble&#39;s done and got the best of me...&quot; This is not the song by   the same title by Elvis or the one by Travis Tritt.  
 Hello,        I am interested in taking Indian classical music lessons specifically    on the bamboo flute (also called bansuri).  I have searched far and    wide for teachers in the Washington D.C., Maryland, or Northern    Virginia area but have not come up with anything.  I have found a    bunch of vocal, tabla (drums), and sitar teachers, as well as other    flute teachers, but not Indian classical or bansuri.  Maybe there is a    search string I haven&#39;t thought of -- if anybody can find me an actual    teacher, I would be much obliged.  I am at the point where even if I    had to drive 2 hours or so away on a weekend morning, I would do it,    so please keep that in mind if it comes down to it!  Thanks in    advance.  
 Who wrote the song, &quot;Oh, what a luccky man he was.&quot;

 I heard this great, Christian song tonight on the radio, and I haven&#39;t   been able to track it down. It&#39;s a woman artist, the song is sort of   R&amp;B. Some of the lyrics as I remember them include &quot;I want to know how   are things between us&quot; and &quot;what&#39;s new since we last spoke.&quot; Please   advise!  
 Are there nightclubs in the DC/Virginia/Maryland metropolitan area    that play Brazilian music?  Or, even better, Angolan music?

 I was shopping at a Sephora store today and heard a great song.  I&#39;ve    heard it somewhere before, but can&#39;t place it.  The song starts with    someone whistling the melody of the hook.  The lyrics contain a line    similar to &quot;would you get along with a guy like me&quot;, or possibly,   &quot;...someone like me&quot; .  The band is   possibly British.  It&#39;s a generally upbeat and happy-feeling song. I&#39;m    almost certain it&#39;s a new-ish release.  Any idea who the band is and    the song title?  
 I&#39;ve been searching for this specific version of O Holy Night for   years. All I know about it is that it was recorded off the radio in   Winnipeg, MB, Canada during the early 90&#39;s. I have a garbled recording   off of an old cassette tape that I put online.     
 I have been looking for a song that I heard on vacation in Greece in    the spring of 2000.  I have been unable to find the song as I don&#39;t    recall the title or singer.  The song was played almost everywhere I    went.  I must have heard it 100 times.  The only information I have is    this:        Female Greek language singer    In the top ten charts in the Spring of 2000    Wasn&#39;t an electronic song, rather it was more like a traditional greek pop song.        I would like to find out the song title.  Could you find a Greek chart    hits for the spring of 2000?  Perhaps that way I could find the    song/artist on the list.        Thank you so much,    Katy W.  
 I&#39;m looking for a song.        In the Thomas Crown Affair movie (the 1999 version), Pierce Brosnan    and Rene Russo dance to a sexy tune played by a band. According to the    movie&#39;s ending credits, and some online references, the song is called    &quot;Cumenco.&quot; It was performed by the &quot;Cumenco All-Stars,&quot; was written by    Raf S. Astor and Eddie Bobe, and was produced by Todd Barkan and Jim    Dunbar.        This song is *not* on the movie&#39;s soundtrack CD, and is not on iTunes.    In fact, it seems to be impossible to find.        If you can find a copy of the song that I can buy online, or download,    for $50 or less, you have answered my question.  
 I&#39;m looking for a karaoke/instrumental version of &quot;Superman&#39;s Song&quot;,    by Crash Test Dummies.  Is there any hope?  I wasn&#39;t easily able to   find a downloadable version, but I was thinking solutions might   include services that convert songs, etc.  Thanks!

 It happened again.  Willis Alan Ramsey played a concert earlier this   month and I found out about it after the event.  I read about it on   Wikipedia of all places.  I guess if I&#39;m looking for a specific answer   it is this:  How  do I get a hold of the new album that Willis has   finished (it was produced by Jamie Oldaker)?  And where and when is   Willis playing in the next year?  
 I am trying to find a recording of Carol Channing singing, &quot;Hello,    Lyndon&quot; (a take off on the song, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;) which she sang at    the 1963 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City. If anybody    can find me either an Mp3 of it, or a CD on which it exists, or any    other form in which I can purchase something and hear the original    version (not the re-recorded versions done by several artists since)    that would be awesome!  
 Ok guys in the move &quot;50 first dates&quot;, there&#39;s a reggae song that plays    at about 11 minutes and 30 seconds into the movie, and if i can make    it out correctly the singer sings something that sounds like &quot;it is    you oh yeaaah&quot;, now what i wanna know is what&#39;s the artist&#39;s name and    what the song nameis...and that&#39;s about it, thank you :-)  
 The last 2 times I was in Canada I saw a music video in rotation of a   white french speaking rapper. He was great and I dont speak french. He   had a almost shaved head and a square face. He may have been from   France...who is he?  
 Still looking for a great tearjerking song classic country song from   the early to mid-eighties that me and my sister still remember and   can&#39;t pinpoint. Lyrics I remember are &quot;...forget me not, regret me not   my darling, I&#39;ll be true as long as these flowers stay true blue...and   if our love should ever die..&quot; The lyrics implying that and the lover   from the song kept replacing faded flowers in order not to have to   face that his loved one would never return to him. Artist and title   please. Album, chart placement, and songwriter would be great. This is   not the song by Wariner. Thanks!  
 Hello,         I have been looking and searching high and wide for an obscure Julee   Cruise song called &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; with no success. Can   you help out here? It was written as the title song to a Wim Wenders   film of the same name, but in the end, the title song went to U2 and   Ms. Cruise contributed a cover of the Elvis tune &quot;Summer Kisses Winter   Tunes&quot; instead.       I am looking for the lyrics to this song. Bonus tip if you can provide   the guitar chords (no links to sheet music, please).       Just to reiterate, it&#39;s NOT the U2 version I&#39;m looking for. Songs with   lyrics about Judas and the line &quot;surrounding me, going down on me&quot; are   not what I&#39;m looking for. Don&#39;t get me wrong -- it&#39;s one of my   all-time favorites by U2. It&#39;s just not the specific version I&#39;m   seeking.       Thanks!  
 Ok I heard a song today on a Seattle radio station between   7:30-8:15pm. It sounded like Coldplay a lot and had the words   Nashville and California in it I think. It was a song played during   the John Tesh show on this station and immediately after the song John   Tesh came on to talk. Does anyone have ANY clue what song that was? I   have never heard it before so I assume it was new. The stations I was   listening to and switching between were 101.5, 103.7, 96.5, and 106.9.   HELP!

 Hi,        I have a collection, between me and my wife, of over 500 CD&#39;s.. some   of which we have ripped at different quality levels on our computers,   some are on external USB drives and some are on DVD&#39;s when we got   those DVD writers.       We also have a few iPods and are also planning to get the new 8gb Nano   and compile what we play the most on to that one for both of us.       I&#39;m not sure how do I go about doing this without losing my data or   getting too much of it onto the smaller Nano iPod&#39;s.       I need advice as to how to manage them with the best software out   there.. Cost isn&#39;t an issue if I&#39;ll lose the headache after spending   the money.       We have four computers that store our music, mostly under iTunes,   three external USB HD&#39;s and a collection of DVD&#39;s I don&#39;t know how   many are those and of course the original roughly 500 music CD&#39;s.       Oh yeah, we also now download from allmymp3.com which is more   convenient for the titles they carry.       HELP! :-)        -Mao

 Hello, my 16-year-old son has recently declared that he loves jazz (of    all things!) ? both playing saxophone and listening to classic ?bop?    songs. I have to admit ? I don?t know anything about jazz, and I    didn?t even know what bop was until I looked it up, but I would love    to get him some jazz CDs for his birthday. If I were to purchase the 5    best ?bop? CDs of all time, what should I get? My search for bop    artists turned up John Coltrane and Miles Davis ? does that sound like    a good way to go? I?m excited that my son is into this, and who knows,    maybe I can learn to like Jazz too! Thanks!  
 Third Eye Blind is a major label band (they were on Elektra). The title    of their latest album Out of the Vein was originally going to be    called Crystal Baller.

Is this true? If it is, read the next questions.        2. What is the catalog number of the Japanese Crystal Baller release?        3. Is there a place where I can buy this release from?        4.

 I was at a club the other night and saw an amazing  concert video of   two drummers. It was two drummers both on risers playing a jam of many   diffrent rock songs. There was some Aerosmith, and Audioslave (I   think). There was also some sort of grey or silver logo in the back.   The partial clip was at least 5 minutes long. Does anyone know what   video this was?

 Please listen to the following 4 minute splice of a song found on a    mix that I downloaded from Kazaa....the entire mp3 file is called    &quot;Classic Alternative Dance Mix&quot; by Jimmy V (yes, very creative, I    know).        I googled the artist and mix name but to no avail.  I have most of the    full lenght version of the songs featured on this 46 minute classic    alternative mix but I really really love this particular 4 min song    that was mixed in.

 I&#39;m looking for the title and artist of a mid-to-late 80&#39;s rock/pop   song I remember from my childhood.  At one time I had it on tape but   simply cannot locate it despite my best efforts.  All I can remember   are a few lyrical phrases, which may not even be accurate, so here   goes:       - You know I&#39;ve got this feeling    - You and me, we&#39;ve got a long long way to go    - I&#39;m standin&#39; on the edge of love (part of chorus)        I&#39;ve done some extensive Googling with some matching, but have reach   the conclusion that some of the words may not be exactly right.  Here   are the songs I&#39;ve eliminated so far:       McFadden &amp; Whitehead - Ain&#39;t No Stoppin&#39; Us Now    Phil Collins - Long Long Way To Go    Hanne Boel - Standing on the Edge of Love    BB King - Standing On The Edge    Tinsley Ellis - Standing On The Edge Of Love

 English phonetic pronunciation of Norwegian Christmas Carol &quot;Jeg er Saa Glad&quot;        Our Sunday School is doing a &quot;Christmas Around the World&quot; program, and    I want my class to sing &quot;Jeg er saa glad hver Julekveld&quot; in English    and Norwegian.

 What&#39;s the name of the song playing in the house in Fast and the    Furious 1, when Paul Walker and Vin Diesel come back home from the    first street race? The song has no words, it&#39;s been stuck in my head    for years and I can&#39;t find it!  
 I remember a song that had a police theme, i&#39;m pretty sure it sampled   Voodoo child  by hendrix. one part of the lyrics &#39;put your hands up   against the wall and spread them&#39; if anyone knows the track i&#39;d be   really happy to get some details. it was in the uk charts, but I&#39;m a   bit hazy on when but i think it was sometime in the last 10 years (not   very helpful i know)  
 I&#39;m looking for the name and agency profile link for the model from   the UK version of the following music video:   Daniel Bedingfield - &quot;Gotta Get Thru This&quot;    Link to the video:   
 I am looking for the music in the TV teaser trailers to several of   Peter jackson&#39;s Lord of the rings movies. shown in the UK. It is also   featured in connection with the film &#39;Requiem for a dream&#39;. It is not   the track entitled &#39;Gothic power&#39;, which is the music accompanying to   LOTR cinema trailers. I consider it a great service if someone can   find it. It would make the best ring tone on my phone ever :) only   joking.       Additional clue, it sounds like violin, or bass.  
 What would be the best solution to capture the sound of a high school   marching band on the field at a live performance?  The band is large   and spread out all over the football field.       The primary attribute one would need to consider is that the sound is   very dispersed, but it all comes from less than 180 degrees in front   of where the microphone would be located.       I&#39;m looking for an ideal microphone type, best suited for that job.        Also, where would be an ideal location to place the mics?  High, low,   middle, far from the band, close to the band?       Also, would I need more than 2?        Thanks!!!  
 What&#39;s the name and artist of the dance remix of a theme from the Overture to    Rocky 2 (not the &quot;famous&quot; Rocky theme) I heard on a radio station in    Athens this June, and what CD album is it featured on  
 Back in 2000 my brother introduced me to a band called &quot;Lokomotiv&quot;   here in the USA by e-mailing me an MP3 of theirs. I&#39;ve done some   research and found that they were supposed to come out with the album   &quot;What&#39;s Your Good Luck?&quot; in 2000 but I&#39;m not sure if that ever   actually happened. I have their Advance CD from Mammouth Records   (which I found on eBay after years of searching) but I&#39;d like to know   if it was ever officially released, and if not, why?       Also, after more research, I found out that the band is originally    from Norway under the name &quot;Locomotives&quot; and have been making CD&#39;s there    since around the mid-1990&#39;s. I really like their music and would like    to get their albums, but I don&#39;t know where to buy them, how    many they came out with, etc. All I know is what I&#39;ve found at

 There was a website at least a few years ago that featured lessons on    songwriting and composing from top songwriters and producers including    (but not limited to) Rodney Jerkins and Max Martin.  What was the name    of this site?  Is it possible to get some of the content from the    site?  Thanks in advance!  
 There was an ad campaign on ESPN a couple of years ago during either    the women&#39;s NCAA basketball season, or the WNBA season.  They played a    very popular song from the 1970s in the background of one of their    ads.  It was a disco-ish song, and in the same neighborhood as Sister    Sledge&#39;s &quot;We Are Family.&quot;  I remember thinking to myself, &quot;I really    like that song.  I need to download it.&quot;  But I forgot to write it    down, and now I&#39;ve forgotten the title.  Female singers.  Upbeat.  I    have no recollection of lyrics or melody.  Can someone help me figure    out the title of this song and the group that sang it?

 there is a techno song that i heard on the radio recently that i    really liked. I figured that i could find it by jotting down a couple    of lines from it. When i got home and searched, however, google drew a    blank. The beginning of the chorus goes something like: &quot;all the    people in this place from coast to coast, put your best foot forward    and rock the house&quot; What is the artist (DJ) and title of this song?  
 I heard this song about 12 years ago on an audio cassette tape.  The   woman who had put the tape together said that it was Reba McIntyre, I   think, but I haven&#39;t been able to confirm that.  The lyrics went   something like this - they were beautiful and told the story of a   little girl who had had a doll when she was young, and was now a young   mother raising a child:       When I was young I had dolls some could walk some could talk    Others would wet when I&#39;d lie &#39;em down        But you, you&#39;re like no doll  
 There was a song on the radio about 16 years ago that was written as a    daughter singing to her dad. The song started with what sounded like a    little girl singing, then it was a teen girl singing and it ended with    a woman    singing... It was like you listened to the little girl grow up    lyrically and vocally. It seems that I remember it being a slower    song. I would love to have the information on this song to use it for    a father/daughter dance at my wedding.        Thanks for your help!  
 I&#39;m looking for the lyrics of few songs of the British folk group of   early seventies The Pentangle.

 I need sheet music for &quot;God Only Knows&quot; by the Beach Boys (from &quot;Pet    Sounds,&quot; of course) for a STRING QUARTET.        Unfortunately, it needs to be for a string quartet specifically (ie,    not a guitar tab).  I don&#39;t really know anything about    music, but i will try to contact the quartet in question if anyone    would like clarifications on what does/doesn&#39;t qualify.        An internet address where I can order it is preferable, but any music    store that will ship it or whatever is fine.  Not sure about an offer    to personally transcribe the sheet music, since I don&#39;t really know    what the going rate for such a thing would be.

 &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; and &quot;Angels We Have Heard On High&quot; sound very very    similar to me. ( I am not a trained musician)  Are they    historically/musically related in anyway?  Or is the similar melody    just a product of chance?

 What are the guitar chords to the traditional Jewish Shabbat song, Shalom Aleichem?  
 I downloaded a version of the old Hoagy Carmichael-Frank Loesser tune   &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;  from iTunes.The Artist and Albums are both listed as   &quot;Rock and Roll Classics&quot; which is not helpful at all. The copyright is   held by Crownstar Records and the cover art is an image of an LP with   a red label saying &quot; Crown Records&quot;.   The male singer is accompanied by strings, horns, piano, a rhythm   section and backup singers and it sounds like it was from the early to   mid Sixties. The arrangment is reminiscent of Smokey Robinson&#39;s &quot; Ooh   Baby Baby&quot; The vocalist is a  tenor and sounds a bit like Smokey or   Johnny Mathis but without so much falsetto.   Can anybody identify it? (It&#39;s not the Cleftones)  
 Where can I buy the instrumental version of this song?

Thank you!  
 I found a song somebody had recorded off the radio. At the end of the   song the female D.J. comes on and says &quot;Boston&#39;s real alternative 1017   FNX. There you go, as promised brand new song from Nine Inch Nails. It   is called Digital. Comes of the forth coming album The Fragile. This   is Sebado (not sure how to spell that) and the flame. It&#39;s Asleep at   the Wheel. FNX&quot; However this song is not a Nine Inch Nails song. The   song is kind of techno industrial with electroinc drums and synth and   some overlapping vocals that make it hard to tell what the lyrics are.   This is what I can gather (... = lyrics I can not make out.): ... I   will always ... you I will be ... ... (maybe &quot;relentless shame&quot;?)If   you want to leave ... ... (here the opening unintelligable words are   repeated.)... ... trust me I will make you feel good ... (opening   lyrics again) I will always ... you I will be ... ... (relentless   shame again?)... (opening lyrics) (now there is a kind of guitar   solo.) ... (opening lyrics again) I will take you ... (up? out?) for a   beautiful ... (tour?) ... ... and ... how&#39;s if feel to be ... baby ...   ... ... don&#39;t ... yourself (now the opening lyrics repeat until the   end of the song.) This is as specific as I can get. The song is about   five minutes ten seconds long. I emailed this radio staton but got no   reply. I can email the song if need be. Who is this!?! I&#39;ve been   searching for over a year!  
 I am looking for a song written in the 80s, the mid 80s I think.  The   genre is pop/rock, or soft rock, and the artist sounds a bit like Mike   and the Mechanics.  I have some of the lyrics in my head, and here   they are:       -Taking in, taking in again, you said I&#39;m the only one but we can be   just friends...   -And if you say....I don&#39;t believe it... And if you....I don&#39;t believe it...

 I am looking for the name of the artist, song and album (and where I can buy    it) of a particular song.  The song is in the electronica / &quot;chill    out&quot; genre, slightly hip hop.  Most of the words are in french except   for the words &quot;long term focus&quot; which are repeated in english quite a   bit.  The song was playing in the lobby of The Shore Club Hotel on   Monday, November 14th around 4:!5 in the afternoon.  
 The name of a rock song and the group that performed it.  Song    received a lot of air play somewhere between &#39;93 and &#39;95.

 Need help looking for a trance song.?    Hello. I downloaded a wonderful song months ago, but my computer died   and I lost all my music. I&#39;ve gotten almost everything, but I&#39;ve been   looking for this song for about a week now with no luck. And it also   doesn&#39;t help that I don&#39;t even remember the song name or who the   artist is.. -_-       The song starts off light and peaceful then slowly builds up with more   music added into the background. Making a magnificent combination of   instruments. There is a lady with a beautiful voice that says   &quot;sunrise&quot; every 10 seconds or so... and &quot;sunrise&quot; is the only word she   says through the whole song. ( this is the songs theme; du du du du du   a do do do a du du du a do do do &#39;sunriiiiiise&#39; and repeating so on   and so forth). And the song is trance, dance, and/or electronic. You   the genre. The song is NOT longer than 7 minutes. If that&#39;s even any   help.       I know this isn&#39;t very much help at all, but I need as much help as I   can get. Even if it&#39;s small, it&#39;s at least something so that&#39;s why I&#39;m   willing to pay so much.  
 I would like a list of places to go watch freestyle rap competitions   (freestyle performances/jams are ok too, but competitions would be   better) in the northeast.  I live in Boston, MA.  So the closer the   better.  I would go as far as New York City.  I would like to get the   venue name and time of performance.       I already got a short list of places from this New York Times article   below.  Please exclude those on the list.  Thank you!

 I learnt a nonsense song from my grandmother (born 1890 in Midlands)   Does anyone know anything about it?  Could the lyrics be Romani?

 There are all sorts of great/innovative DJs out there today like   Tiesto and Sasha. But what will electronic music sound like 10 or 20   years from now? It&#39;s such a new sort of music (relatively) that it&#39;s   hard to know where it&#39;s heading. I did some poking around online - but   I couldn&#39;t find ANY opinions about this! What do you think? I look   forward to reading your insights.  
 I am trying to find a comprehensive list of live music    venues/promoters in England that currently put on rock n roll bands.        The aim is to have a downloadable Excel compatible file that has    several columns containing venue information.  For example, name of    venue, address, contact name and telephone number, email, website,    etc.        I realise that not every venue will have a website or email address    but I would still like them to be included in the results.        I would like the results in some kind of geographical order, for    instance, it could be ordered by region, i.e. Manchester in the North    West.        I found this website which lists the largest cities in the UK:      
 Hi. I was on vaccation in Turkey 2002 (during the Soccer World   Champoinship). I&#39;m looking for a song that was played alot in the   radio as well as in restaurants during the time of my stay. I got the   feeling that this song was a radio-&quot;Hit&quot; that summer. The song was   relatively calm and slow with a (I my view) nice melody played on some   kind of flute. I don&#39;t think there was a drum beat, and if if there   were drums, they were discrete. The song was in Turkish (I guess). The   singer was a male. The main melody is both singed by the singer and   played by the flute in the middle play. The singer sings the melody   remarkeable &quot;stronger /more intense&quot; later on in the song. I&#39;m a   little bit uncertain, but mu guess is that the main melody theme is   something like CCDEFEDCBBCDCDCD (pauses/lengths ommited).       My question is: Which song am I thinking of?  
 I have had this fragmented song stuck in my head for several years now   and I want to find out the actual song name.

 I&#39;m looking for sources that can tell me about new songs, rumored   songs and upcoming songs.       I&#39;d like to know about songs before they hit the radios and as soon as   it&#39;s released.  A few sources I know about include checking the   following sites and blogs:       music.aol.com/songs/newsongs    perezhilton.com        These sites don&#39;t always have the latest and sometimes are even a week   late.  I&#39;d like a list of other sources I can look through to find out   about new songs/albums/singles as soon as they&#39;re announced/rumored.  
 I am trying to set up a charity auction on eBay benefitting &quot;Journey   for the Cure Foundation&quot; - The Journey for the Cure Foundation proudly   supports the MS Society, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society and St. Judes   Children Hospital. They specfically fund research to find cures for   these associated diseases. Proudly, 100% of their financing goes   directly to find the cure and they have no paid staff or employees.   This auction would be for my collection of Cure albums (over 50) in a   LOT auction.  100% of the proceeds would go to Journey for the Cure   Foundation through MissionFish (the eBay Charitable donations   organizers for such events).  My question:  Does anyone know how to   get in touch with either Geffen Records (and WHO at Geffen to contact   about this) and/or Robert Smith of the Cure to obtain personal   Autographs for/on my collection or donations of merchandise to add to   this auction. Until I have attempted to gather more items, the auction   will not take place.  Any voluntary help is appreciated.  
 I&#39;m trying to find out the name of this obscure early 80&#39;s pop band,   and album names.  They were   from Ohio.  They were signed to Capitol records, and I think they put    out 1, maybe 2 albums.  The group consisted of 3 members, 2 of whom    were brothers.  Thank you.  
 I was given a copy of the album in question (on tape; with no info) in   the late 80&#39;s, while I was pre-teen. I never discovered any   information about the album or artist; although, I do recall hearing   some of the music on European TVs (series, news spots, etc.) around   the same period.       Only clues I can offer:        - I am 99% certain that the artist is European (most likely German).        - The album started with a German speaking announcer introducing   &quot;Johann ???&quot; (I think) to a cheering crowed: &quot;Damen und Herren,   Johann...&quot;.       - Tones / Sounds: While I don&#39;t recall any particular piece of music   from the tape (album); I do, however, distinctively recall the tones /   sounds. For instance, the sound heard in the background on track 11 of   Prodigy&#39;s Music for Jilted Generation (1:31 ? 37 into the song), and   several others bits on this particular track (are likely the same   synthesizer).       I require Artist and Album information.        Thanks,        Johans  
 During the late 70&#39;s-early 80&#39;s, there was playing a great country   song with lyrics that included, &quot;...t-r-o-u-b-l-e, well I think that   old trouble&#39;s done and got the best of me...&quot; This is not the song by   the same title by Elvis or the one by Travis Tritt.  
 Hello,        I am interested in taking Indian classical music lessons specifically    on the bamboo flute (also called bansuri).  I have searched far and    wide for teachers in the Washington D.C., Maryland, or Northern    Virginia area but have not come up with anything.  I have found a    bunch of vocal, tabla (drums), and sitar teachers, as well as other    flute teachers, but not Indian classical or bansuri.  Maybe there is a    search string I haven&#39;t thought of -- if anybody can find me an actual    teacher, I would be much obliged.  I am at the point where even if I    had to drive 2 hours or so away on a weekend morning, I would do it,    so please keep that in mind if it comes down to it!  Thanks in    advance.

 I heard this great, Christian song tonight on the radio, and I haven&#39;t   been able to track it down. It&#39;s a woman artist, the song is sort of   R&amp;B. Some of the lyrics as I remember them include &quot;I want to know how   are things between us&quot; and &quot;what&#39;s new since we last spoke.&quot; Please   advise!

 I was shopping at a Sephora store today and heard a great song.  I&#39;ve    heard it somewhere before, but can&#39;t place it.  The song starts with    someone whistling the melody of the hook.  The lyrics contain a line    similar to &quot;would you get along with a guy like me&quot;, or possibly,   &quot;...someone like me&quot; .  The band is   possibly British.  It&#39;s a generally upbeat and happy-feeling song. I&#39;m    almost certain it&#39;s a new-ish release.  Any idea who the band is and    the song title?  
 I&#39;ve been searching for this specific version of O Holy Night for   years. All I know about it is that it was recorded off the radio in   Winnipeg, MB, Canada during the early 90&#39;s. I have a garbled recording   off of an old cassette tape that I put online.     
 I have been looking for a song that I heard on vacation in Greece in    the spring of 2000.  I have been unable to find the song as I don&#39;t    recall the title or singer.  The song was played almost everywhere I    went.  I must have heard it 100 times.  The only information I have is    this:        Female Greek language singer    In the top ten charts in the Spring of 2000    Wasn&#39;t an electronic song, rather it was more like a traditional greek pop song.        I would like to find out the song title.  Could you find a Greek chart    hits for the spring of 2000?  Perhaps that way I could find the    song/artist on the list.        Thank you so much,    Katy W.  
 I&#39;m looking for a song.        In the Thomas Crown Affair movie (the 1999 version), Pierce Brosnan    and Rene Russo dance to a sexy tune played by a band. According to the    movie&#39;s ending credits, and some online references, the song is called    &quot;Cumenco.&quot; It was performed by the &quot;Cumenco All-Stars,&quot; was written by    Raf S. Astor and Eddie Bobe, and was produced by Todd Barkan and Jim    Dunbar.        This song is *not* on the movie&#39;s soundtrack CD, and is not on iTunes.    In fact, it seems to be impossible to find.        If you can find a copy of the song that I can buy online, or download,    for $50 or less, you have answered my question.  
 I&#39;m looking for a karaoke/instrumental version of &quot;Superman&#39;s Song&quot;,    by Crash Test Dummies.  Is there any hope?  I wasn&#39;t easily able to   find a downloadable version, but I was thinking solutions might   include services that convert songs, etc.  Thanks!

 It happened again.  Willis Alan Ramsey played a concert earlier this   month and I found out about it after the event.  I read about it on   Wikipedia of all places.  I guess if I&#39;m looking for a specific answer   it is this:  How  do I get a hold of the new album that Willis has   finished (it was produced by Jamie Oldaker)?  And where and when is   Willis playing in the next year?  
 I am trying to find a recording of Carol Channing singing, &quot;Hello,    Lyndon&quot; (a take off on the song, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;) which she sang at    the 1963 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City. If anybody    can find me either an Mp3 of it, or a CD on which it exists, or any    other form in which I can purchase something and hear the original    version (not the re-recorded versions done by several artists since)    that would be awesome!  
 Ok guys in the move &quot;50 first dates&quot;, there&#39;s a reggae song that plays    at about 11 minutes and 30 seconds into the movie, and if i can make    it out correctly the singer sings something that sounds like &quot;it is    you oh yeaaah&quot;, now what i wanna know is what&#39;s the artist&#39;s name and    what the song nameis...and that&#39;s about it, thank you :-)

 Still looking for a great tearjerking song classic country song from   the early to mid-eighties that me and my sister still remember and   can&#39;t pinpoint. Lyrics I remember are &quot;...forget me not, regret me not   my darling, I&#39;ll be true as long as these flowers stay true blue...and   if our love should ever die..&quot; The lyrics implying that and the lover   from the song kept replacing faded flowers in order not to have to   face that his loved one would never return to him. Artist and title   please. Album, chart placement, and songwriter would be great. This is   not the song by Wariner. Thanks!  
 Hello,         I have been looking and searching high and wide for an obscure Julee   Cruise song called &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; with no success. Can   you help out here? It was written as the title song to a Wim Wenders   film of the same name, but in the end, the title song went to U2 and   Ms. Cruise contributed a cover of the Elvis tune &quot;Summer Kisses Winter   Tunes&quot; instead.       I am looking for the lyrics to this song. Bonus tip if you can provide   the guitar chords (no links to sheet music, please).       Just to reiterate, it&#39;s NOT the U2 version I&#39;m looking for. Songs with   lyrics about Judas and the line &quot;surrounding me, going down on me&quot; are   not what I&#39;m looking for. Don&#39;t get me wrong -- it&#39;s one of my   all-time favorites by U2. It&#39;s just not the specific version I&#39;m   seeking.       Thanks!  
 Ok I heard a song today on a Seattle radio station between   7:30-8:15pm. It sounded like Coldplay a lot and had the words   Nashville and California in it I think. It was a song played during   the John Tesh show on this station and immediately after the song John   Tesh came on to talk. Does anyone have ANY clue what song that was? I   have never heard it before so I assume it was new. The stations I was   listening to and switching between were 101.5, 103.7, 96.5, and 106.9.   HELP!

 Hi,        I have a collection, between me and my wife, of over 500 CD&#39;s.. some   of which we have ripped at different quality levels on our computers,   some are on external USB drives and some are on DVD&#39;s when we got   those DVD writers.       We also have a few iPods and are also planning to get the new 8gb Nano   and compile what we play the most on to that one for both of us.       I&#39;m not sure how do I go about doing this without losing my data or   getting too much of it onto the smaller Nano iPod&#39;s.       I need advice as to how to manage them with the best software out   there.. Cost isn&#39;t an issue if I&#39;ll lose the headache after spending   the money.       We have four computers that store our music, mostly under iTunes,   three external USB HD&#39;s and a collection of DVD&#39;s I don&#39;t know how   many are those and of course the original roughly 500 music CD&#39;s.       Oh yeah, we also now download from allmymp3.com which is more   convenient for the titles they carry.       HELP! :-)        -Mao

 Hello, my 16-year-old son has recently declared that he loves jazz (of    all things!) ? both playing saxophone and listening to classic ?bop?    songs. I have to admit ? I don?t know anything about jazz, and I    didn?t even know what bop was until I looked it up, but I would love    to get him some jazz CDs for his birthday. If I were to purchase the 5    best ?bop? CDs of all time, what should I get? My search for bop    artists turned up John Coltrane and Miles Davis ? does that sound like    a good way to go? I?m excited that my son is into this, and who knows,    maybe I can learn to like Jazz too! Thanks!  
 Third Eye Blind is a major label band (they were on Elektra). The title    of their latest album Out of the Vein was originally going to be    called Crystal Baller.

Is this true? If it is, read the next questions.        2. What is the catalog number of the Japanese Crystal Baller release?        3. Is there a place where I can buy this release from?        4.

 I was at a club the other night and saw an amazing  concert video of   two drummers. It was two drummers both on risers playing a jam of many   diffrent rock songs. There was some Aerosmith, and Audioslave (I   think). There was also some sort of grey or silver logo in the back.   The partial clip was at least 5 minutes long. Does anyone know what   video this was?

 Please listen to the following 4 minute splice of a song found on a    mix that I downloaded from Kazaa....the entire mp3 file is called    &quot;Classic Alternative Dance Mix&quot; by Jimmy V (yes, very creative, I    know).        I googled the artist and mix name but to no avail.  I have most of the    full lenght version of the songs featured on this 46 minute classic    alternative mix but I really really love this particular 4 min song    that was mixed in.        I&#39;ve googled the lyrics, but again, to no avail.. HELP!!!!        I would like to know who sings it and where I can get a copy of it...    or at least the name of the song and artist.

 I&#39;m looking for the title and artist of a mid-to-late 80&#39;s rock/pop   song I remember from my childhood.  At one time I had it on tape but   simply cannot locate it despite my best efforts.  All I can remember   are a few lyrical phrases, which may not even be accurate, so here   goes:       - You know I&#39;ve got this feeling    - You and me, we&#39;ve got a long long way to go    - I&#39;m standin&#39; on the edge of love (part of chorus)        I&#39;ve done some extensive Googling with some matching, but have reach   the conclusion that some of the words may not be exactly right.  Here   are the songs I&#39;ve eliminated so far:       McFadden &amp; Whitehead - Ain&#39;t No Stoppin&#39; Us Now    Phil Collins - Long Long Way To Go    Hanne Boel - Standing on the Edge of Love    BB King - Standing On The Edge    Tinsley Ellis - Standing On The Edge Of Love

 What would be the best solution to capture the sound of a high school   marching band on the field at a live performance?  The band is large   and spread out all over the football field.       The primary attribute one would need to consider is that the sound is   very dispersed, but it all comes from less than 180 degrees in front   of where the microphone would be located.       I&#39;m looking for an ideal microphone type, best suited for that job.        Also, where would be an ideal location to place the mics?  High, low,   middle, far from the band, close to the band?       Also, would I need more than 2?        Thanks!!!  
 What&#39;s the name and artist of the dance remix of a theme from the Overture to    Rocky 2 (not the &quot;famous&quot; Rocky theme) I heard on a radio station in    Athens this June, and what CD album is it featured on  
 Back in 2000 my brother introduced me to a band called &quot;Lokomotiv&quot;   here in the USA by e-mailing me an MP3 of theirs. I&#39;ve done some   research and found that they were supposed to come out with the album   &quot;What&#39;s Your Good Luck?&quot; in 2000 but I&#39;m not sure if that ever   actually happened. I have their Advance CD from Mammouth Records   (which I found on eBay after years of searching) but I&#39;d like to know   if it was ever officially released, and if not, why?       Also, after more research, I found out that the band is originally    from Norway under the name &quot;Locomotives&quot; and have been making CD&#39;s there    since around the mid-1990&#39;s. I really like their music and would like    to get their albums, but I don&#39;t know where to buy them, how    many they came out with, etc. All I know is what I&#39;ve found at

 There was an ad campaign on ESPN a couple of years ago during either    the women&#39;s NCAA basketball season, or the WNBA season.  They played a    very popular song from the 1970s in the background of one of their    ads.  It was a disco-ish song, and in the same neighborhood as Sister    Sledge&#39;s &quot;We Are Family.&quot;  I remember thinking to myself, &quot;I really    like that song.  I need to download it.&quot;  But I forgot to write it    down, and now I&#39;ve forgotten the title.  Female singers.  Upbeat.  I    have no recollection of lyrics or melody.  Can someone help me figure    out the title of this song and the group that sang it?

 there is a techno song that i heard on the radio recently that i    really liked. I figured that i could find it by jotting down a couple    of lines from it.

 I heard this song about 12 years ago on an audio cassette tape.  The   woman who had put the tape together said that it was Reba McIntyre, I   think, but I haven&#39;t been able to confirm that.  The lyrics went   something like this - they were beautiful and told the story of a   little girl who had had a doll when she was young, and was now a young   mother raising a child:       When I was young I had dolls some could walk some could talk    Others would wet when I&#39;d lie &#39;em down        But you, you&#39;re like no doll  
 There was a song on the radio about 16 years ago that was written as a    daughter singing to her dad. The song started with what sounded like a    little girl singing, then it was a teen girl singing and it ended with    a woman    singing... It was like you listened to the little girl grow up    lyrically and vocally. It seems that I remember it being a slower    song. I would love to have the information on this song to use it for    a father/daughter dance at my wedding.        Thanks for your help!

 I need sheet music for &quot;God Only Knows&quot; by the Beach Boys (from &quot;Pet    Sounds,&quot; of course) for a STRING QUARTET.        Unfortunately, it needs to be for a string quartet specifically (ie,    not a guitar tab).  I don&#39;t really know anything about    music, but i will try to contact the quartet in question if anyone    would like clarifications on what does/doesn&#39;t qualify.        An internet address where I can order it is preferable, but any music    store that will ship it or whatever is fine.  Not sure about an offer    to personally transcribe the sheet music, since I don&#39;t really know    what the going rate for such a thing would be.

 I downloaded a version of the old Hoagy Carmichael-Frank Loesser tune   &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;  from iTunes.The Artist and Albums are both listed as   &quot;Rock and Roll Classics&quot; which is not helpful at all. The copyright is   held by Crownstar Records and the cover art is an image of an LP with   a red label saying &quot; Crown Records&quot;.   The male singer is accompanied by strings, horns, piano, a rhythm   section and backup singers and it sounds like it was from the early to   mid Sixties. The arrangment is reminiscent of Smokey Robinson&#39;s &quot; Ooh   Baby Baby&quot; The vocalist is a  tenor and sounds a bit like Smokey or   Johnny Mathis but without so much falsetto.   Can anybody identify it? (It&#39;s not the Cleftones)

 I found a song somebody had recorded off the radio. At the end of the   song the female D.J. comes on and says &quot;Boston&#39;s real alternative 1017   FNX. There you go, as promised brand new song from Nine Inch Nails. It   is called Digital. Comes of the forth coming album The Fragile. This   is Sebado (not sure how to spell that) and the flame. It&#39;s Asleep at   the Wheel. FNX&quot; However this song is not a Nine Inch Nails song. The   song is kind of techno industrial with electroinc drums and synth and   some overlapping vocals that make it hard to tell what the lyrics are.   This is what I can gather (... = lyrics I can not make out.): ... I   will always ... you I will be ... ... (maybe &quot;relentless shame&quot;?)If   you want to leave ... ... (here the opening unintelligable words are   repeated.)... ... trust me I will make you feel good ... (opening   lyrics again) I will always ... you I will be ... ... (relentless   shame again?)... (opening lyrics) (now there is a kind of guitar   solo.) ... (opening lyrics again) I will take you ... (up? out?) for a   beautiful ... (tour?) ... ... and ... how&#39;s if feel to be ... baby ...   ... ... don&#39;t ... yourself (now the opening lyrics repeat until the   end of the song.) This is as specific as I can get. The song is about   five minutes ten seconds long. I emailed this radio staton but got no   reply. I can email the song if need be. Who is this!?! I&#39;ve been   searching for over a year!  
 I am looking for a song written in the 80s, the mid 80s I think.  The   genre is pop/rock, or soft rock, and the artist sounds a bit like Mike   and the Mechanics.  I have some of the lyrics in my head, and here   they are:       -Taking in, taking in again, you said I&#39;m the only one but we can be   just friends...   -And if you say....I don&#39;t believe it... And if you....I don&#39;t believe it...

 I am looking for the name of the artist, song and album (and where I can buy    it) of a particular song.  The song is in the electronica / &quot;chill    out&quot; genre, slightly hip hop.  Most of the words are in french except   for the words &quot;long term focus&quot; which are repeated in english quite a   bit.  The song was playing in the lobby of The Shore Club Hotel on   Monday, November 14th around 4:!5 in the afternoon.  
 The name of a rock song and the group that performed it.  Song    received a lot of air play somewhere between &#39;93 and &#39;95.

 Need help looking for a trance song.?    Hello. I downloaded a wonderful song months ago, but my computer died   and I lost all my music. I&#39;ve gotten almost everything, but I&#39;ve been   looking for this song for about a week now with no luck. And it also   doesn&#39;t help that I don&#39;t even remember the song name or who the   artist is.. -_-       The song starts off light and peaceful then slowly builds up with more   music added into the background. Making a magnificent combination of   instruments. There is a lady with a beautiful voice that says   &quot;sunrise&quot; every 10 seconds or so... and &quot;sunrise&quot; is the only word she   says through the whole song. ( this is the songs theme; du du du du du   a do do do a du du du a do do do &#39;sunriiiiiise&#39; and repeating so on   and so forth). And the song is trance, dance, and/or electronic. You   the genre. The song is NOT longer than 7 minutes. If that&#39;s even any   help.       I know this isn&#39;t very much help at all, but I need as much help as I   can get. Even if it&#39;s small, it&#39;s at least something so that&#39;s why I&#39;m   willing to pay so much.  
 I would like a list of places to go watch freestyle rap competitions   (freestyle performances/jams are ok too, but competitions would be   better) in the northeast.  I live in Boston, MA.  So the closer the   better.  I would go as far as New York City.  I would like to get the   venue name and time of performance.       I already got a short list of places from this New York Times article   below.  Please exclude those on the list.  Thank you!

 I learnt a nonsense song from my grandmother (born 1890 in Midlands)   Does anyone know anything about it?  Could the lyrics be Romani?

 There are all sorts of great/innovative DJs out there today like   Tiesto and Sasha. But what will electronic music sound like 10 or 20   years from now? It&#39;s such a new sort of music (relatively) that it&#39;s   hard to know where it&#39;s heading. I did some poking around online - but   I couldn&#39;t find ANY opinions about this! What do you think? I look   forward to reading your insights.  
 I am trying to find a comprehensive list of live music    venues/promoters in England that currently put on rock n roll bands.        The aim is to have a downloadable Excel compatible file that has    several columns containing venue information.  For example, name of    venue, address, contact name and telephone number, email, website,    etc.        I realise that not every venue will have a website or email address    but I would still like them to be included in the results.        I would like the results in some kind of geographical order, for    instance, it could be ordered by region, i.e. Manchester in the North    West.        I found this website which lists the largest cities in the UK:      
 Hi. I was on vaccation in Turkey 2002 (during the Soccer World   Champoinship). I&#39;m looking for a song that was played alot in the   radio as well as in restaurants during the time of my stay. I got the   feeling that this song was a radio-&quot;Hit&quot; that summer. The song was   relatively calm and slow with a (I my view) nice melody played on some   kind of flute. I don&#39;t think there was a drum beat, and if if there   were drums, they were discrete. The song was in Turkish (I guess). The   singer was a male. The main melody is both singed by the singer and   played by the flute in the middle play. The singer sings the melody   remarkeable &quot;stronger /more intense&quot; later on in the song. I&#39;m a   little bit uncertain, but mu guess is that the main melody theme is   something like CCDEFEDCBBCDCDCD (pauses/lengths ommited).       My question is: Which song am I thinking of?  
 I have had this fragmented song stuck in my head for several years now   and I want to find out the actual song name. The song is at least five   years old and popular enough to have been played on mainstream radio   once or twice in Australia. I have the opening part of the song but   that is all, the link is

 I&#39;m looking for sources that can tell me about new songs, rumored   songs and upcoming songs.       I&#39;d like to know about songs before they hit the radios and as soon as   it&#39;s released.  A few sources I know about include checking the   following sites and blogs:       music.aol.com/songs/newsongs    perezhilton.com        These sites don&#39;t always have the latest and sometimes are even a week   late.  I&#39;d like a list of other sources I can look through to find out   about new songs/albums/singles as soon as they&#39;re announced/rumored.  
 I am trying to set up a charity auction on eBay benefitting &quot;Journey   for the Cure Foundation&quot; - The Journey for the Cure Foundation proudly   supports the MS Society, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society and St. Judes   Children Hospital. They specfically fund research to find cures for   these associated diseases. Proudly, 100% of their financing goes   directly to find the cure and they have no paid staff or employees.   This auction would be for my collection of Cure albums (over 50) in a   LOT auction.  100% of the proceeds would go to Journey for the Cure   Foundation through MissionFish (the eBay Charitable donations   organizers for such events).  My question:  Does anyone know how to   get in touch with either Geffen Records (and WHO at Geffen to contact   about this) and/or Robert Smith of the Cure to obtain personal   Autographs for/on my collection or donations of merchandise to add to   this auction. Until I have attempted to gather more items, the auction   will not take place.  Any voluntary help is appreciated.  
 I&#39;m trying to find out the name of this obscure early 80&#39;s pop band,   and album names.  They were   from Ohio.  They were signed to Capitol records, and I think they put    out 1, maybe 2 albums.  The group consisted of 3 members, 2 of whom    were brothers.  Thank you.  
 I was given a copy of the album in question (on tape; with no info) in   the late 80&#39;s, while I was pre-teen. I never discovered any   information about the album or artist; although, I do recall hearing   some of the music on European TVs (series, news spots, etc.) around   the same period.       Only clues I can offer:        - I am 99% certain that the artist is European (most likely German).        - The album started with a German speaking announcer introducing   &quot;Johann ???&quot; (I think) to a cheering crowed: &quot;Damen und Herren,   Johann...&quot;.       - Tones / Sounds: While I don&#39;t recall any particular piece of music   from the tape (album); I do, however, distinctively recall the tones /   sounds. For instance, the sound heard in the background on track 11 of   Prodigy&#39;s Music for Jilted Generation (1:31 ? 37 into the song), and   several others bits on this particular track (are likely the same   synthesizer).       I require Artist and Album information.        Thanks,        Johans  
 During the late 70&#39;s-early 80&#39;s, there was playing a great country   song with lyrics that included, &quot;...t-r-o-u-b-l-e, well I think that   old trouble&#39;s done and got the best of me...&quot; This is not the song by   the same title by Elvis or the one by Travis Tritt.  
 Hello,        I am interested in taking Indian classical music lessons specifically    on the bamboo flute (also called bansuri).  I have searched far and    wide for teachers in the Washington D.C., Maryland, or Northern    Virginia area but have not come up with anything.  I have found a    bunch of vocal, tabla (drums), and sitar teachers, as well as other    flute teachers, but not Indian classical or bansuri.  Maybe there is a    search string I haven&#39;t thought of -- if anybody can find me an actual    teacher, I would be much obliged.  I am at the point where even if I    had to drive 2 hours or so away on a weekend morning, I would do it,    so please keep that in mind if it comes down to it!  Thanks in    advance.  
 Who wrote the song, &quot;Oh, what a luccky man he was.&quot;

 I heard this great, Christian song tonight on the radio, and I haven&#39;t   been able to track it down. It&#39;s a woman artist, the song is sort of   R&amp;B. Some of the lyrics as I remember them include &quot;I want to know how   are things between us&quot; and &quot;what&#39;s new since we last spoke.&quot; Please   advise!  
 Are there nightclubs in the DC/Virginia/Maryland metropolitan area    that play Brazilian music?  Or, even better, Angolan music?

 I was shopping at a Sephora store today and heard a great song.  I&#39;ve    heard it somewhere before, but can&#39;t place it.  The song starts with    someone whistling the melody of the hook.  The lyrics contain a line    similar to &quot;would you get along with a guy like me&quot;, or possibly,   &quot;...someone like me&quot; .  The band is   possibly British.  It&#39;s a generally upbeat and happy-feeling song. I&#39;m    almost certain it&#39;s a new-ish release.  Any idea who the band is and    the song title?  
 I&#39;ve been searching for this specific version of O Holy Night for   years. All I know about it is that it was recorded off the radio in   Winnipeg, MB, Canada during the early 90&#39;s. I have a garbled recording   off of an old cassette tape that I put online.     
 I have been looking for a song that I heard on vacation in Greece in    the spring of 2000.  I have been unable to find the song as I don&#39;t    recall the title or singer.  The song was played almost everywhere I    went.  I must have heard it 100 times.  The only information I have is    this:        Female Greek language singer    In the top ten charts in the Spring of 2000    Wasn&#39;t an electronic song, rather it was more like a traditional greek pop song.        I would like to find out the song title.  Could you find a Greek chart    hits for the spring of 2000?  Perhaps that way I could find the    song/artist on the list.        Thank you so much,    Katy W.  
 I&#39;m looking for a song.        In the Thomas Crown Affair movie (the 1999 version), Pierce Brosnan    and Rene Russo dance to a sexy tune played by a band. According to the    movie&#39;s ending credits, and some online references, the song is called    &quot;Cumenco.&quot; It was performed by the &quot;Cumenco All-Stars,&quot; was written by    Raf S. Astor and Eddie Bobe, and was produced by Todd Barkan and Jim    Dunbar.        This song is *not* on the movie&#39;s soundtrack CD, and is not on iTunes.    In fact, it seems to be impossible to find.        If you can find a copy of the song that I can buy online, or download,    for $50 or less, you have answered my question.  
 I&#39;m looking for a karaoke/instrumental version of &quot;Superman&#39;s Song&quot;,    by Crash Test Dummies.  Is there any hope?  I wasn&#39;t easily able to   find a downloadable version, but I was thinking solutions might   include services that convert songs, etc.  Thanks!

 It happened again.  Willis Alan Ramsey played a concert earlier this   month and I found out about it after the event.  I read about it on   Wikipedia of all places.  I guess if I&#39;m looking for a specific answer   it is this:  How  do I get a hold of the new album that Willis has   finished (it was produced by Jamie Oldaker)?  And where and when is   Willis playing in the next year?  
 I am trying to find a recording of Carol Channing singing, &quot;Hello,    Lyndon&quot; (a take off on the song, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;) which she sang at    the 1963 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City. If anybody    can find me either an Mp3 of it, or a CD on which it exists, or any    other form in which I can purchase something and hear the original    version (not the re-recorded versions done by several artists since)    that would be awesome!  
 Ok guys in the move &quot;50 first dates&quot;, there&#39;s a reggae song that plays    at about 11 minutes and 30 seconds into the movie, and if i can make    it out correctly the singer sings something that sounds like &quot;it is    you oh yeaaah&quot;, now what i wanna know is what&#39;s the artist&#39;s name and    what the song nameis...and that&#39;s about it, thank you :-)

 Still looking for a great tearjerking song classic country song from   the early to mid-eighties that me and my sister still remember and   can&#39;t pinpoint. Lyrics I remember are &quot;...forget me not, regret me not   my darling, I&#39;ll be true as long as these flowers stay true blue...and   if our love should ever die..&quot; The lyrics implying that and the lover   from the song kept replacing faded flowers in order not to have to   face that his loved one would never return to him. Artist and title   please. Album, chart placement, and songwriter would be great. This is   not the song by Wariner. Thanks!  
 Hello,         I have been looking and searching high and wide for an obscure Julee   Cruise song called &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; with no success. Can   you help out here? It was written as the title song to a Wim Wenders   film of the same name, but in the end, the title song went to U2 and   Ms. Cruise contributed a cover of the Elvis tune &quot;Summer Kisses Winter   Tunes&quot; instead.       I am looking for the lyrics to this song. Bonus tip if you can provide   the guitar chords (no links to sheet music, please).       Just to reiterate, it&#39;s NOT the U2 version I&#39;m looking for. Songs with   lyrics about Judas and the line &quot;surrounding me, going down on me&quot; are   not what I&#39;m looking for. Don&#39;t get me wrong -- it&#39;s one of my   all-time favorites by U2. It&#39;s just not the specific version I&#39;m   seeking.       Thanks!  
 Ok I heard a song today on a Seattle radio station between   7:30-8:15pm. It sounded like Coldplay a lot and had the words   Nashville and California in it I think. It was a song played during   the John Tesh show on this station and immediately after the song John   Tesh came on to talk. Does anyone have ANY clue what song that was? I   have never heard it before so I assume it was new. The stations I was   listening to and switching between were 101.5, 103.7, 96.5, and 106.9.   HELP!

 Hi,        I have a collection, between me and my wife, of over 500 CD&#39;s.. some   of which we have ripped at different quality levels on our computers,   some are on external USB drives and some are on DVD&#39;s when we got   those DVD writers.       We also have a few iPods and are also planning to get the new 8gb Nano   and compile what we play the most on to that one for both of us.       I&#39;m not sure how do I go about doing this without losing my data or   getting too much of it onto the smaller Nano iPod&#39;s.       I need advice as to how to manage them with the best software out   there.. Cost isn&#39;t an issue if I&#39;ll lose the headache after spending   the money.       We have four computers that store our music, mostly under iTunes,   three external USB HD&#39;s and a collection of DVD&#39;s I don&#39;t know how   many are those and of course the original roughly 500 music CD&#39;s.       Oh yeah, we also now download from allmymp3.com which is more   convenient for the titles they carry.       HELP! :-)        -Mao

 Hello, my 16-year-old son has recently declared that he loves jazz (of    all things!) ? both playing saxophone and listening to classic ?bop?    songs. I have to admit ? I don?t know anything about jazz, and I    didn?t even know what bop was until I looked it up, but I would love    to get him some jazz CDs for his birthday. If I were to purchase the 5    best ?bop? CDs of all time, what should I get? My search for bop    artists turned up John Coltrane and Miles Davis ? does that sound like    a good way to go? I?m excited that my son is into this, and who knows,    maybe I can learn to like Jazz too! Thanks!  
 Third Eye Blind is a major label band (they were on Elektra). The title    of their latest album Out of the Vein was originally going to be    called Crystal Baller. There are rumors that the album was actually    released in Japan under this name for a very short time before they    rereleased it under the Out of the Vein title, well before the US    release was actually out.        1. Is this true? If it is, read the next questions.        2. What is the catalog number of the Japanese Crystal Baller release?        3. Is there a place where I can buy this release from?        4. BONUS QUESTION (not required for payment): What does the cover art    for the Japanese Crystal Baller release look like? Point me to a URL.        Thanks!        Ethan

 I was at a club the other night and saw an amazing  concert video of   two drummers. It was two drummers both on risers playing a jam of many   diffrent rock songs. There was some Aerosmith, and Audioslave (I   think). There was also some sort of grey or silver logo in the back.   The partial clip was at least 5 minutes long. Does anyone know what   video this was?

 Please listen to the following 4 minute splice of a song found on a    mix that I downloaded from Kazaa....the entire mp3 file is called    &quot;Classic Alternative Dance Mix&quot; by Jimmy V (yes, very creative, I    know).        I googled the artist and mix name but to no avail.  I have most of the    full lenght version of the songs featured on this 46 minute classic    alternative mix but I really really love this particular 4 min song    that was mixed in.        I&#39;ve googled the lyrics, but again, to no avail.. HELP!!!!        I would like to know who sings it and where I can get a copy of it...    or at least the name of the song and artist.        If you want the entire mix, (it&#39;s really good! and 65mb in lenght) let me know!          
 I&#39;m looking for the complete lyrics to a song called &quot;The Other Side&quot;   which is sung by Maria Nayler.  This song is track 12 on the album   &quot;United DJs of America, Vol. 10: Los Angeles&quot; and the DJ is Taylor.  
 I am looking for effective methods of getting my music heard.  I know    about Soundclick/Purevolume/MySpace; but I am planning on producing    and selling my own CD&#39;s from my own home.        What are some of the best methods of getting the &quot;word&quot; out and generating interest?  
 I&#39;m looking for the title and artist of a mid-to-late 80&#39;s rock/pop   song I remember from my childhood.  At one time I had it on tape but   simply cannot locate it despite my best efforts.  All I can remember   are a few lyrical phrases, which may not even be accurate, so here   goes:       - You know I&#39;ve got this feeling    - You and me, we&#39;ve got a long long way to go    - I&#39;m standin&#39; on the edge of love (part of chorus)        I&#39;ve done some extensive Googling with some matching, but have reach   the conclusion that some of the words may not be exactly right.  Here   are the songs I&#39;ve eliminated so far:       McFadden &amp; Whitehead - Ain&#39;t No Stoppin&#39; Us Now    Phil Collins - Long Long Way To Go    Hanne Boel - Standing on the Edge of Love    BB King - Standing On The Edge    Tinsley Ellis - Standing On The Edge Of Love

 I remember a song that had a police theme, i&#39;m pretty sure it sampled   Voodoo child  by hendrix. one part of the lyrics &#39;put your hands up   against the wall and spread them&#39; if anyone knows the track i&#39;d be   really happy to get some details. it was in the uk charts, but I&#39;m a   bit hazy on when but i think it was sometime in the last 10 years (not   very helpful i know)

 I am looking for the music in the TV teaser trailers to several of   Peter jackson&#39;s Lord of the rings movies. shown in the UK. It is also   featured in connection with the film &#39;Requiem for a dream&#39;. It is not   the track entitled &#39;Gothic power&#39;, which is the music accompanying to   LOTR cinema trailers. I consider it a great service if someone can   find it. It would make the best ring tone on my phone ever :) only   joking.       Additional clue, it sounds like violin, or bass.  
 What would be the best solution to capture the sound of a high school   marching band on the field at a live performance?  The band is large   and spread out all over the football field.       The primary attribute one would need to consider is that the sound is   very dispersed, but it all comes from less than 180 degrees in front   of where the microphone would be located.       I&#39;m looking for an ideal microphone type, best suited for that job.        Also, where would be an ideal location to place the mics?  High, low,   middle, far from the band, close to the band?       Also, would I need more than 2?        Thanks!!!  
 What&#39;s the name and artist of the dance remix of a theme from the Overture to    Rocky 2 (not the &quot;famous&quot; Rocky theme) I heard on a radio station in    Athens this June, and what CD album is it featured on  
 Back in 2000 my brother introduced me to a band called &quot;Lokomotiv&quot;   here in the USA by e-mailing me an MP3 of theirs. I&#39;ve done some   research and found that they were supposed to come out with the album   &quot;What&#39;s Your Good Luck?&quot; in 2000 but I&#39;m not sure if that ever   actually happened. I have their Advance CD from Mammouth Records   (which I found on eBay after years of searching) but I&#39;d like to know   if it was ever officially released, and if not, why?       Also, after more research, I found out that the band is originally    from Norway under the name &quot;Locomotives&quot; and have been making CD&#39;s there    since around the mid-1990&#39;s. I really like their music and would like    to get their albums, but I don&#39;t know where to buy them, how    many they came out with, etc. All I know is what I&#39;ve found at

 There was a website at least a few years ago that featured lessons on    songwriting and composing from top songwriters and producers including    (but not limited to) Rodney Jerkins and Max Martin.

 There was an ad campaign on ESPN a couple of years ago during either    the women&#39;s NCAA basketball season, or the WNBA season.  They played a    very popular song from the 1970s in the background of one of their    ads.  It was a disco-ish song, and in the same neighborhood as Sister    Sledge&#39;s &quot;We Are Family.&quot;  I remember thinking to myself, &quot;I really    like that song.  I need to download it.&quot;  But I forgot to write it    down, and now I&#39;ve forgotten the title.  Female singers.  Upbeat.  I    have no recollection of lyrics or melody.  Can someone help me figure    out the title of this song and the group that sang it?

 there is a techno song that i heard on the radio recently that i    really liked. I figured that i could find it by jotting down a couple    of lines from it. When i got home and searched, however, google drew a    blank. The beginning of the chorus goes something like: &quot;all the    people in this place from coast to coast, put your best foot forward    and rock the house&quot; What is the artist (DJ) and title of this song?  
 I heard this song about 12 years ago on an audio cassette tape.  The   woman who had put the tape together said that it was Reba McIntyre, I   think, but I haven&#39;t been able to confirm that.  The lyrics went   something like this - they were beautiful and told the story of a   little girl who had had a doll when she was young, and was now a young   mother raising a child:       When I was young I had dolls some could walk some could talk    Others would wet when I&#39;d lie &#39;em down        But you, you&#39;re like no doll  
 There was a song on the radio about 16 years ago that was written as a    daughter singing to her dad. The song started with what sounded like a    little girl singing, then it was a teen girl singing and it ended with    a woman    singing... It was like you listened to the little girl grow up    lyrically and vocally. It seems that I remember it being a slower    song. I would love to have the information on this song to use it for    a father/daughter dance at my wedding.        Thanks for your help!

 I need sheet music for &quot;God Only Knows&quot; by the Beach Boys (from &quot;Pet    Sounds,&quot; of course) for a STRING QUARTET.        Unfortunately, it needs to be for a string quartet specifically (ie,    not a guitar tab).  I don&#39;t really know anything about    music, but i will try to contact the quartet in question if anyone    would like clarifications on what does/doesn&#39;t qualify.        An internet address where I can order it is preferable, but any music    store that will ship it or whatever is fine.  Not sure about an offer    to personally transcribe the sheet music, since I don&#39;t really know    what the going rate for such a thing would be.

 &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; and &quot;Angels We Have Heard On High&quot; sound very very    similar to me. ( I am not a trained musician)  Are they    historically/musically related in anyway?  Or is the similar melody    just a product of chance?

 I downloaded a version of the old Hoagy Carmichael-Frank Loesser tune   &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;  from iTunes.The Artist and Albums are both listed as   &quot;Rock and Roll Classics&quot; which is not helpful at all. The copyright is   held by Crownstar Records and the cover art is an image of an LP with   a red label saying &quot; Crown Records&quot;.   The male singer is accompanied by strings, horns, piano, a rhythm   section and backup singers and it sounds like it was from the early to   mid Sixties. The arrangment is reminiscent of Smokey Robinson&#39;s &quot; Ooh   Baby Baby&quot; The vocalist is a  tenor and sounds a bit like Smokey or   Johnny Mathis but without so much falsetto.   Can anybody identify it? (It&#39;s not the Cleftones)

Thank you!  
 I found a song somebody had recorded off the radio. At the end of the   song the female D.J. comes on and says &quot;Boston&#39;s real alternative 1017   FNX. There you go, as promised brand new song from Nine Inch Nails. It   is called Digital. Comes of the forth coming album The Fragile. This   is Sebado (not sure how to spell that) and the flame. It&#39;s Asleep at   the Wheel. FNX&quot; However this song is not a Nine Inch Nails song. The   song is kind of techno industrial with electroinc drums and synth and   some overlapping vocals that make it hard to tell what the lyrics are.   This is what I can gather (... = lyrics I can not make out.): ... I   will always ... you I will be ... ... (maybe &quot;relentless shame&quot;?)If   you want to leave ... ... (here the opening unintelligable words are   repeated.)... ... trust me I will make you feel good ... (opening   lyrics again) I will always ... you I will be ... ... (relentless   shame again?)... (opening lyrics) (now there is a kind of guitar   solo.) ... (opening lyrics again) I will take you ... (up? out?) for a   beautiful ... (tour?) ... ... and ... how&#39;s if feel to be ... baby ...   ... ... don&#39;t ... yourself (now the opening lyrics repeat until the   end of the song.) This is as specific as I can get. The song is about   five minutes ten seconds long. I emailed this radio staton but got no   reply. I can email the song if need be. Who is this!?! I&#39;ve been   searching for over a year!  
 I am looking for a song written in the 80s, the mid 80s I think.  The   genre is pop/rock, or soft rock, and the artist sounds a bit like Mike   and the Mechanics.  I have some of the lyrics in my head, and here   they are:       -Taking in, taking in again, you said I&#39;m the only one but we can be   just friends...   -And if you say....I don&#39;t believe it... And if you....I don&#39;t believe it...

 I am looking for the name of the artist, song and album (and where I can buy    it) of a particular song.  The song is in the electronica / &quot;chill    out&quot; genre, slightly hip hop.  Most of the words are in french except   for the words &quot;long term focus&quot; which are repeated in english quite a   bit.  The song was playing in the lobby of The Shore Club Hotel on   Monday, November 14th around 4:!5 in the afternoon.

 Need help looking for a trance song.?    Hello. I downloaded a wonderful song months ago, but my computer died   and I lost all my music. I&#39;ve gotten almost everything, but I&#39;ve been   looking for this song for about a week now with no luck. And it also   doesn&#39;t help that I don&#39;t even remember the song name or who the   artist is.. -_-       The song starts off light and peaceful then slowly builds up with more   music added into the background. Making a magnificent combination of   instruments. There is a lady with a beautiful voice that says   &quot;sunrise&quot; every 10 seconds or so... and &quot;sunrise&quot; is the only word she   says through the whole song. ( this is the songs theme; du du du du du   a do do do a du du du a do do do &#39;sunriiiiiise&#39; and repeating so on   and so forth). And the song is trance, dance, and/or electronic. You   the genre. The song is NOT longer than 7 minutes. If that&#39;s even any   help.       I know this isn&#39;t very much help at all, but I need as much help as I   can get. Even if it&#39;s small, it&#39;s at least something so that&#39;s why I&#39;m   willing to pay so much.  
 I would like a list of places to go watch freestyle rap competitions   (freestyle performances/jams are ok too, but competitions would be   better) in the northeast.  I live in Boston, MA.

 There are all sorts of great/innovative DJs out there today like   Tiesto and Sasha. But what will electronic music sound like 10 or 20   years from now? It&#39;s such a new sort of music (relatively) that it&#39;s   hard to know where it&#39;s heading. I did some poking around online - but   I couldn&#39;t find ANY opinions about this! What do you think? I look   forward to reading your insights.  
 I am trying to find a comprehensive list of live music    venues/promoters in England that currently put on rock n roll bands.        The aim is to have a downloadable Excel compatible file that has    several columns containing venue information.  For example, name of    venue, address, contact name and telephone number, email, website,    etc.        I realise that not every venue will have a website or email address    but I would still like them to be included in the results.        I would like the results in some kind of geographical order, for    instance, it could be ordered by region, i.e. Manchester in the North    West.        I found this website which lists the largest cities in the UK:      
 Hi. I was on vaccation in Turkey 2002 (during the Soccer World   Champoinship). I&#39;m looking for a song that was played alot in the   radio as well as in restaurants during the time of my stay. I got the   feeling that this song was a radio-&quot;Hit&quot; that summer. The song was   relatively calm and slow with a (I my view) nice melody played on some   kind of flute. I don&#39;t think there was a drum beat, and if if there   were drums, they were discrete. The song was in Turkish (I guess). The   singer was a male. The main melody is both singed by the singer and   played by the flute in the middle play. The singer sings the melody   remarkeable &quot;stronger /more intense&quot; later on in the song. I&#39;m a   little bit uncertain, but mu guess is that the main melody theme is   something like CCDEFEDCBBCDCDCD (pauses/lengths ommited).       My question is: Which song am I thinking of?  
 I have had this fragmented song stuck in my head for several years now   and I want to find out the actual song name.

 I&#39;m looking for sources that can tell me about new songs, rumored   songs and upcoming songs.       I&#39;d like to know about songs before they hit the radios and as soon as   it&#39;s released.  A few sources I know about include checking the   following sites and blogs:       music.aol.com/songs/newsongs    perezhilton.com        These sites don&#39;t always have the latest and sometimes are even a week   late.  I&#39;d like a list of other sources I can look through to find out   about new songs/albums/singles as soon as they&#39;re announced/rumored.  
 I am trying to set up a charity auction on eBay benefitting &quot;Journey   for the Cure Foundation&quot; - The Journey for the Cure Foundation proudly   supports the MS Society, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society and St. Judes   Children Hospital. They specfically fund research to find cures for   these associated diseases. Proudly, 100% of their financing goes   directly to find the cure and they have no paid staff or employees.   This auction would be for my collection of Cure albums (over 50) in a   LOT auction.  100% of the proceeds would go to Journey for the Cure   Foundation through MissionFish (the eBay Charitable donations   organizers for such events).  My question:  Does anyone know how to   get in touch with either Geffen Records (and WHO at Geffen to contact   about this) and/or Robert Smith of the Cure to obtain personal   Autographs for/on my collection or donations of merchandise to add to   this auction. Until I have attempted to gather more items, the auction   will not take place.  Any voluntary help is appreciated.  
 I&#39;m trying to find out the name of this obscure early 80&#39;s pop band,   and album names.  They were   from Ohio.  They were signed to Capitol records, and I think they put    out 1, maybe 2 albums.  The group consisted of 3 members, 2 of whom    were brothers.  Thank you.  
 I was given a copy of the album in question (on tape; with no info) in   the late 80&#39;s, while I was pre-teen. I never discovered any   information about the album or artist; although, I do recall hearing   some of the music on European TVs (series, news spots, etc.) around   the same period.       Only clues I can offer:        - I am 99% certain that the artist is European (most likely German).        - The album started with a German speaking announcer introducing   &quot;Johann ???&quot; (I think) to a cheering crowed: &quot;Damen und Herren,   Johann...&quot;.       - Tones / Sounds: While I don&#39;t recall any particular piece of music   from the tape (album); I do, however, distinctively recall the tones /   sounds. For instance, the sound heard in the background on track 11 of   Prodigy&#39;s Music for Jilted Generation (1:31 ? 37 into the song), and   several others bits on this particular track (are likely the same   synthesizer).       I require Artist and Album information.        Thanks,        Johans  
 During the late 70&#39;s-early 80&#39;s, there was playing a great country   song with lyrics that included, &quot;...t-r-o-u-b-l-e, well I think that   old trouble&#39;s done and got the best of me...&quot; This is not the song by   the same title by Elvis or the one by Travis Tritt.  
 Hello,        I am interested in taking Indian classical music lessons specifically    on the bamboo flute (also called bansuri).  I have searched far and    wide for teachers in the Washington D.C., Maryland, or Northern    Virginia area but have not come up with anything.  I have found a    bunch of vocal, tabla (drums), and sitar teachers, as well as other    flute teachers, but not Indian classical or bansuri.  Maybe there is a    search string I haven&#39;t thought of -- if anybody can find me an actual    teacher, I would be much obliged.  I am at the point where even if I    had to drive 2 hours or so away on a weekend morning, I would do it,    so please keep that in mind if it comes down to it!  Thanks in    advance.  
 Who wrote the song, &quot;Oh, what a luccky man he was.&quot;

 I heard this great, Christian song tonight on the radio, and I haven&#39;t   been able to track it down. It&#39;s a woman artist, the song is sort of   R&amp;B. Some of the lyrics as I remember them include &quot;I want to know how   are things between us&quot; and &quot;what&#39;s new since we last spoke.&quot; Please   advise!  
 Are there nightclubs in the DC/Virginia/Maryland metropolitan area    that play Brazilian music?  Or, even better, Angolan music?  
 Please name the two best available recordings of Stravinsky&#39;s &quot;Rite of Spring&quot;  
 I was shopping at a Sephora store today and heard a great song.  I&#39;ve    heard it somewhere before, but can&#39;t place it.  The song starts with    someone whistling the melody of the hook.  The lyrics contain a line    similar to &quot;would you get along with a guy like me&quot;, or possibly,   &quot;...someone like me&quot; .  The band is   possibly British.  It&#39;s a generally upbeat and happy-feeling song. I&#39;m    almost certain it&#39;s a new-ish release.  Any idea who the band is and    the song title?  
 I&#39;ve been searching for this specific version of O Holy Night for   years. All I know about it is that it was recorded off the radio in   Winnipeg, MB, Canada during the early 90&#39;s. I have a garbled recording   off of an old cassette tape that I put online.     
 I have been looking for a song that I heard on vacation in Greece in    the spring of 2000.  I have been unable to find the song as I don&#39;t    recall the title or singer.  The song was played almost everywhere I    went.  I must have heard it 100 times.  The only information I have is    this:        Female Greek language singer    In the top ten charts in the Spring of 2000    Wasn&#39;t an electronic song, rather it was more like a traditional greek pop song.        I would like to find out the song title.  Could you find a Greek chart    hits for the spring of 2000?  Perhaps that way I could find the    song/artist on the list.        Thank you so much,    Katy W.  
 I&#39;m looking for a song.        In the Thomas Crown Affair movie (the 1999 version), Pierce Brosnan    and Rene Russo dance to a sexy tune played by a band. According to the    movie&#39;s ending credits, and some online references, the song is called    &quot;Cumenco.&quot; It was performed by the &quot;Cumenco All-Stars,&quot; was written by    Raf S. Astor and Eddie Bobe, and was produced by Todd Barkan and Jim    Dunbar.        This song is *not* on the movie&#39;s soundtrack CD, and is not on iTunes.    In fact, it seems to be impossible to find.        If you can find a copy of the song that I can buy online, or download,    for $50 or less, you have answered my question.  
 I&#39;m looking for a karaoke/instrumental version of &quot;Superman&#39;s Song&quot;,    by Crash Test Dummies.  Is there any hope?  I wasn&#39;t easily able to   find a downloadable version, but I was thinking solutions might   include services that convert songs, etc.  Thanks!

 It happened again.  Willis Alan Ramsey played a concert earlier this   month and I found out about it after the event.  I read about it on   Wikipedia of all places.  I guess if I&#39;m looking for a specific answer   it is this:  How  do I get a hold of the new album that Willis has   finished (it was produced by Jamie Oldaker)?  And where and when is   Willis playing in the next year?  
 I am trying to find a recording of Carol Channing singing, &quot;Hello,    Lyndon&quot; (a take off on the song, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;) which she sang at    the 1963 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City. If anybody    can find me either an Mp3 of it, or a CD on which it exists, or any    other form in which I can purchase something and hear the original    version (not the re-recorded versions done by several artists since)    that would be awesome!  
 Ok guys in the move &quot;50 first dates&quot;, there&#39;s a reggae song that plays    at about 11 minutes and 30 seconds into the movie, and if i can make    it out correctly the singer sings something that sounds like &quot;it is    you oh yeaaah&quot;, now what i wanna know is what&#39;s the artist&#39;s name and    what the song nameis...and that&#39;s about it, thank you :-)  
 The last 2 times I was in Canada I saw a music video in rotation of a   white french speaking rapper. He was great and I dont speak french. He   had a almost shaved head and a square face. He may have been from   France...who is he?  
 Still looking for a great tearjerking song classic country song from   the early to mid-eighties that me and my sister still remember and   can&#39;t pinpoint. Lyrics I remember are &quot;...forget me not, regret me not   my darling, I&#39;ll be true as long as these flowers stay true blue...and   if our love should ever die..&quot; The lyrics implying that and the lover   from the song kept replacing faded flowers in order not to have to   face that his loved one would never return to him. Artist and title   please. Album, chart placement, and songwriter would be great. This is   not the song by Wariner. Thanks!  
 Hello,         I have been looking and searching high and wide for an obscure Julee   Cruise song called &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; with no success. Can   you help out here? It was written as the title song to a Wim Wenders   film of the same name, but in the end, the title song went to U2 and   Ms. Cruise contributed a cover of the Elvis tune &quot;Summer Kisses Winter   Tunes&quot; instead.       I am looking for the lyrics to this song. Bonus tip if you can provide   the guitar chords (no links to sheet music, please).       Just to reiterate, it&#39;s NOT the U2 version I&#39;m looking for. Songs with   lyrics about Judas and the line &quot;surrounding me, going down on me&quot; are   not what I&#39;m looking for. Don&#39;t get me wrong -- it&#39;s one of my   all-time favorites by U2. It&#39;s just not the specific version I&#39;m   seeking.       Thanks!  
 Ok I heard a song today on a Seattle radio station between   7:30-8:15pm. It sounded like Coldplay a lot and had the words   Nashville and California in it I think. It was a song played during   the John Tesh show on this station and immediately after the song John   Tesh came on to talk. Does anyone have ANY clue what song that was? I   have never heard it before so I assume it was new. The stations I was   listening to and switching between were 101.5, 103.7, 96.5, and 106.9.   HELP!

 Hi,        I have a collection, between me and my wife, of over 500 CD&#39;s.. some   of which we have ripped at different quality levels on our computers,   some are on external USB drives and some are on DVD&#39;s when we got   those DVD writers.       We also have a few iPods and are also planning to get the new 8gb Nano   and compile what we play the most on to that one for both of us.       I&#39;m not sure how do I go about doing this without losing my data or   getting too much of it onto the smaller Nano iPod&#39;s.       I need advice as to how to manage them with the best software out   there.. Cost isn&#39;t an issue if I&#39;ll lose the headache after spending   the money.       We have four computers that store our music, mostly under iTunes,   three external USB HD&#39;s and a collection of DVD&#39;s I don&#39;t know how   many are those and of course the original roughly 500 music CD&#39;s.       Oh yeah, we also now download from allmymp3.com which is more   convenient for the titles they carry.       HELP! :-)        -Mao

 Hello, my 16-year-old son has recently declared that he loves jazz (of    all things!) ? both playing saxophone and listening to classic ?bop?    songs. I have to admit ? I don?t know anything about jazz, and I    didn?t even know what bop was until I looked it up, but I would love    to get him some jazz CDs for his birthday. If I were to purchase the 5    best ?bop? CDs of all time, what should I get? My search for bop    artists turned up John Coltrane and Miles Davis ? does that sound like    a good way to go? I?m excited that my son is into this, and who knows,    maybe I can learn to like Jazz too! Thanks!  
 Third Eye Blind is a major label band (they were on Elektra). The title    of their latest album Out of the Vein was originally going to be    called Crystal Baller.

Is this true? If it is, read the next questions.        2. What is the catalog number of the Japanese Crystal Baller release?        3. Is there a place where I can buy this release from?        4.

 I was at a club the other night and saw an amazing  concert video of   two drummers. It was two drummers both on risers playing a jam of many   diffrent rock songs. There was some Aerosmith, and Audioslave (I   think). There was also some sort of grey or silver logo in the back.   The partial clip was at least 5 minutes long. Does anyone know what   video this was?

 Please listen to the following 4 minute splice of a song found on a    mix that I downloaded from Kazaa....the entire mp3 file is called    &quot;Classic Alternative Dance Mix&quot; by Jimmy V (yes, very creative, I    know).        I googled the artist and mix name but to no avail.  I have most of the    full lenght version of the songs featured on this 46 minute classic    alternative mix but I really really love this particular 4 min song    that was mixed in.        I&#39;ve googled the lyrics, but again, to no avail.. HELP!!!!        I would like to know who sings it and where I can get a copy of it...    or at least the name of the song and artist.

 I&#39;m looking for the title and artist of a mid-to-late 80&#39;s rock/pop   song I remember from my childhood.  At one time I had it on tape but   simply cannot locate it despite my best efforts.  All I can remember   are a few lyrical phrases, which may not even be accurate, so here   goes:       - You know I&#39;ve got this feeling    - You and me, we&#39;ve got a long long way to go    - I&#39;m standin&#39; on the edge of love (part of chorus)        I&#39;ve done some extensive Googling with some matching, but have reach   the conclusion that some of the words may not be exactly right.  Here   are the songs I&#39;ve eliminated so far:       McFadden &amp; Whitehead - Ain&#39;t No Stoppin&#39; Us Now    Phil Collins - Long Long Way To Go    Hanne Boel - Standing on the Edge of Love    BB King - Standing On The Edge    Tinsley Ellis - Standing On The Edge Of Love

It is also   featured in connection with the film &#39;Requiem for a dream&#39;. It is not   the track entitled &#39;Gothic power&#39;, which is the music accompanying to   LOTR cinema trailers.

 What would be the best solution to capture the sound of a high school   marching band on the field at a live performance?  The band is large   and spread out all over the football field.       The primary attribute one would need to consider is that the sound is   very dispersed, but it all comes from less than 180 degrees in front   of where the microphone would be located.       I&#39;m looking for an ideal microphone type, best suited for that job.        Also, where would be an ideal location to place the mics?  High, low,   middle, far from the band, close to the band?       Also, would I need more than 2?        Thanks!!!  
 What&#39;s the name and artist of the dance remix of a theme from the Overture to    Rocky 2 (not the &quot;famous&quot; Rocky theme) I heard on a radio station in    Athens this June, and what CD album is it featured on  
 Back in 2000 my brother introduced me to a band called &quot;Lokomotiv&quot;   here in the USA by e-mailing me an MP3 of theirs. I&#39;ve done some   research and found that they were supposed to come out with the album   &quot;What&#39;s Your Good Luck?&quot; in 2000 but I&#39;m not sure if that ever   actually happened. I have their Advance CD from Mammouth Records   (which I found on eBay after years of searching) but I&#39;d like to know   if it was ever officially released, and if not, why?       Also, after more research, I found out that the band is originally    from Norway under the name &quot;Locomotives&quot; and have been making CD&#39;s there    since around the mid-1990&#39;s. I really like their music and would like    to get their albums, but I don&#39;t know where to buy them, how    many they came out with, etc. All I know is what I&#39;ve found at
