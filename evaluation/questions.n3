good answer, but It went bad before Tim did that song and then did a song called "back when" that says this:

I'm readin' Street Slang For Dummies
Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money
The way it was back then
country was great up to the 90's I would say, I dont know what happened, some people say that "Urban Cowboy" messed it all up.
I would say that it went bad with "boot scootin boogie" or maybe billy ray cyrus
that was in 1992, he was the vanilla ice of country music now hes hosting nashville star I believe, that song was horrble back then, but now it just sounds like any other song on the radio today
well, im in texas and have plenty of real country music to listen to, but I just hate to see the mainstream country music go down in flames, i mean dierks bently just released a greatest hits album, wtf, in 20 years what will be classic country, trace adkins badonkadonk?
