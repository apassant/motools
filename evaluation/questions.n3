A dusky sundown on an Arizona freeway, driving lonely on a hot summers day.
A vastness of orange desert without the slightest sound., not a chance of life for miles around.
The red skies glow with glory, a road taking me into a fairytale story.

Why, I say. What a beautiful Arizona day.
Sand whiter than  the whiteness of salt lake,
The remoteness of this road, sends freedom my way.
I own this road, for gods sake.

The roadsides lined with cacti for miles, 
At speeds so fast they become nothing but green walls with yellow tiles.
The sun is half cut beneath a mighty dune, when its gone,
it’ll be replaced by a cole desert moon.

(Music slows down)

<#1214995207> dc:description """I'm certain I couldn't have made this up, but I've been asking around & searching for awhile..

Had to have been between 00'-04'.. I can't remember who the group was, or anything about the song really, but in the music video there was a visual of an alarm clock showing "12:08". I don't think it was a line of the lyrics (I've searched and found nothing) but I believe there were subtitles that said "12:08, Our Last Goodbye". That's the part thats important to me and the only thing that truely stands out. For the longest time I thought it was an Incubus song, but when I actually looked into it & tried to look it up, that was a completely different song. From what I remember it was an all male group (Not an individual singer) Pop/Alt/whatever you want to call the genre.. I saw the video on MTV or VH1.

If anyone knows what I'm talking about I would GREATLY appreciate any info. This has been in the back of my mind for years LOL. I need to know this memory actually exists :P

He said because that is how you HAVE to hold the stick with your left hand. So I gave up. Later I saw bands playing with the more "natural grip" with both hands. Why do people still teach this ludicrous "orthodox grip" this was invented when drums were worn on the left side when marching. This makes sense. But to use the same grip when the drums are situated in front of you seems stupid. Why would a teacher insist on you learning "orthodox grip" when it's not necessary? bang went my drumming career.

No, it isn't any collaboration between Bow Wow and Ciara. The beat reminds me of Aaliyah's Somebody, so it was probably written by Timbaland.

We've all had our time to grow

Protest the way we're built don't point the blame on me

Cover me, unwanted clemency

In spirit I'll be there

I would really appreciate your professional views on this....

I have a tight budget and I just sold my beginner electric guitar (yamaha) to my frnd. So now, I'm guitar-less! I've been wanting to buy a professional electric guitar for almost a year now. So I went out and did some research and the only worthwhile pieces I came across were:

1. Dean Guitars (Dimebag, V, etc.)
2. ESP MH-400
3. Ibanez JEM (Steve Vai Sig. - not with the gold hardware and pearl inlays)

I play mostly hard rock / heavy metal genres. I loved the fact tht the ESP MH-400 had active EMG 81/85 pups (so I'm slightly biased to the ESP)

<#1214979158> dc:description """Ok, whoever can figure out which song I'm talk about is awesome.  I have no idea what the song's name is, or which artist made it.  And to my knowledge the song contains very little lyrics, and the few words that are said in it I don't know because I always paid attention to the music.  So the only description I can manage to give of the song is pretty vague, so that's why anyone who can figure out which song I'm talking about has to be some sort of musical deity.  Ok, so here's what I can describe of the song:

I'm pretty sure one would classify it as a techno song.

The intro, and I'm pretty sure main part of the song, is something that sounds like several people (emulating a crowd I'm pretty sure) cheering (as if at some sports game) with something that sounds like the letter "o" with the tone of that sound going up and down with the beat of the song.


That's the best I can describe what I know of the song.  If anyone has any possible, outlsandish even, idea please respond!!
Not Sandstorm (although it is a good song)

Why do 6 year olds enjoy the annoying Hannah Montanna and her lyp-syncing? is it because she puts in a good performance and mouthes words well is it because shes "pritttey" my guess is that she is entertaing obvoiusly, but when you perform in front of a large age range of people,whats best (to do)?

Disgrace
-------------------

I’m a soldier in this rap game
I’m gonna make sure you know my name
When I spit I’m a lit fuse
I can attack anyone of yous
Here I count in twos
Two four six pick up sticks
Grab that branch and hit you in your face
Look at you crying like you got spayed with mace
Saying “Please no stay away from that gun!”
About time I called fucking 911
So I can take the law in my fucking hands
The New Kids better watch out I hate boy bands
My 9 is almost out you might be the last
This finger’s getting happy my millimeter is about to kick your ass
Switch it with my Uzi don’t worry I’ll end you fast
Faster than road runner runs over coyotes ass(beep beep)(bitch)
 
[Hook]
Get the fuck up here spit in my face
You’re a fucking disgrace to the rapping race
You’re ruining Tupac’s name pissing on his grave
Destroying the road he paved
It’s time I put you in your damn grave

I’m beginning the second verse
My dissing here is a lot worse
It’ll leave you bleeding and in a hearse
My lyrical knife to your throat
I dare you one last time come on gloat!
Come on let one little word slip you better bite your lip
Hip hop straight to the spiting
Hell no I’m not quitting
B-Rabbit kept on with his raps spilling it
I will too with my realest and illest shit
So you can keep feeling this word for word
Line for line I be writing all the time
Rhyme for rhyme ready to shine
Some new rap in my mind left to find
No single thought left behind
Behind a sign that I should be a rapper 

[Hook]
Get the fuck up here spit in my face
You’re a fucking disgrace to the rapping race
You’re ruining Tupac’s name pissing on his grave
Destroying the road he paved
It’s time I put you in your damn grave
 
I’m a rapper you with no likes of such
A rapper with no rap vendetta
Rappers know they can’t hit what they can’t touch
Like women want what they can’t have
These battles I don’t love
Because push just came to shove
Lower the bar make it hard
This is my power my art
I keep on painting keep writing the next line’s rhyme
Talking about the shit that happen last week 
You talking about nonsense that shit’s weak
You want to be shot piss me off
I’ll take this nine to your chest with that fake S
I’m tired of your fake shit your ruining the game
Your only in it for the money and the fame
Crank dat crank what? What da hell you talking about?

Has our conscience shown?
Has the sweet breeze blown?
Has all the kindness gone?
Hope still lingers on.
I drink myself of newfound pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why.

Are we listening?
Hymns of offering.
Have we eyes to see?
Love is gathering.
All the words that I've been reading
Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one.

So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below.
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down.
'Cause it's the world I know.
It's the world I know.

9.Lil' Wayne (Debatable, I know, I just like his creative lyrics, which some people aren't quick enough to understand)

something something (maybe you are) "All I see". And then went into "your happiness is raining all over (or down) on me"

John W., thanks for your answer, but I think you misunderstood the question. You didn't read it very well. I didn't ask women how good or big their poopers are. I asked them how much better poopers THEY ARE if they usually listen to country music, than if they listen to other music.

<#1214966710> dc:description """yeah busta rhyme has been in the game for a while but for whoever said he could even hang with lil wayne in a free style battel must be on drugs. lil wayne has way more experience coming from off the dome. if buster even atempted to even try to battle wayne in a battle no only would he lose but he would look really foolish. i admit busta can rap but he needs a pad and a pen as with lil wayne his pad and pen is coming off the dome . the reason he is considered the all time best rapper
lil wayne doesnt need mix tapes to come off the dome. i said busta use to be hot in the rap game but he has not originality when you are comparing him to a legend like lil wayne . lil wayne is just to experienced at punch lines without a pad coming off the dome and i dont just mean mix tapes .doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out why he is so hot and he is being considered the greatest rapper of all time . im sorry but busta hasnt proven anything . he can rap but you would have to be on drugs to even think busta can even be in the same category as wayne as legends let alone even put his name next to his .
are you kidding me he cant be calling himself the best ? weezy is a lyrical genius that makes a living off of making albums from off his dome while other people write it down for him . if your going to call the ghost writing i guess that a compliment . meaning he doesnt need a pen and a pad and the words just flow on the paper so that ghost? you basically complimented weezy and dont even know it . you never hear about people saying busta would even come close to weezy let alone busta even saying it himself . all you hear is lil wayne is the best until you come on here then you have haters who deny what a true mc is . busta hasnt proven nothing in his career and you will never hear his name when it comes to the best rappers let alone a true freestyler like weezy .
william thanks for the verse you always have haters. when jayz was running things there was haters,when pac ,and biggie was around it was haters now its weezy
i never said that lil wayne never writes his rhymes at all . but as far as freestyling and coming from off the dome he does it about 90% of the time . even kanye said when he worked with him in the studio he is impressed and believe hes the best . i complimented busta and said he can rap but we are talking about rappers who are consideredthe greatest . and im the only person who ever said he was the greatest are you kidding me ? you have rappers like kanye complimenting him you have article about him being the best . but why are we jumping off to other rappers and about comments how im the only person who said hes the best ? this topic was basically toward a previous poster who said that busta rhymes could hang with wayne . yeah you hear busta was a good rapper but he never made the impact a weezy,busta,jayz,pac,or biggie did on hiphop plus hes very creative with his rhymes . i give busta his props as a good rappers but hes not made of a legend like weezy or the other rappe i named

<#1214965398> dc:title """Do you think the reason some people misunderstand rap and rock is because it's now desegregated?""".
<#1214965398> dc:description """The only time in history when rock and rap were enjoyed by blacks and whites in large numbers is during the Monterary Pop Festival Era. In other words kids, the 1960s. Back then, you had blacks and whites that both enjoyed many different genres of music. But at the same time. Both races very much misunderstood each other.

I think this is a prime example of history repeating itself, but not as violent and ignorant as it was back then. But now during the internet age, cultural differences are more exposed and have helped to desegregate music more than ever before. The only problem is that most new artists don't have a clue of what they are dong, and that goes for both rap and rock.

In other words, some (not all) people that criticize rap or rock are going back into the ignorant naive way of thinking about music genres in general. These types of people do not move ahead, but focus on the stereotypes of those genres, and the things that they only play on the radio.

Agreed?

<#1214964084> dc:title """Do you belive a true music lover attempts to listen to All forms of music and not just rock?""".
<#1214964084> dc:description """Alright, i consider myself a true music fan; a fan of nearly all music genres. I grew up on rap and rock, and a person who grew up on both of these and listens to both knows how to find artists that best reflect the true talent in the genres.

So labeling one as Talentless makes one Tasteless, if you know what i mean.

My favorite rock bands include Earth and Fire, The United States of America, Darkside Mirrors, early Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Jefferson Airplane, Moody Blues, L7, Hendrix, BB King, Syd Barret(my himself), Joe Byrd and the Field Hippies, H.P Lovecraft, Broadcast, The Electric Prunes, and many, many more.

Favorite rap artist, include Pastor Troy, Pac, Talib Kweli, Lauren Hill, MC Lyte, Sha Rock, T Rock, KRS One, Nas, Three Six Mafia (their old underground stuff before they were famous), and many many more.

So, as you can see, if you actually seek and find the music, you will know that there is actually good to rap. and good to rock, if you truly are a fan of music.
I truly believe that more people that come on here and quote the fad line "I think rap is crap" have never even took the time out to seek and find things that aren't played on the radio, and things that weren't made in the past 5 years. Most of these types of people have bad taste in rock as well.
