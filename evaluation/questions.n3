good answer, but It went bad before Tim did that song and then did a song called "back when" that says this:

country was great up to the 90's I would say, I dont know what happened, some people say that "Urban Cowboy" messed it all up.
I would say that it went bad with "boot scootin boogie" or maybe billy ray cyrus
that was in 1992, he was the vanilla ice of country music now hes hosting nashville star I believe, that song was horrble back then, but now it just sounds like any other song on the radio today
well, im in texas and have plenty of real country music to listen to, but I just hate to see the mainstream country music go down in flames, i mean dierks bently just released a greatest hits album, wtf, in 20 years what will be classic country, trace adkins badonkadonk?

We had good chemistry between each other while we improvised, but when we started composing a song, it looked like we got lost in our own ideas.

Note that we can play anything from soft classical rock to hardcore metal, as well as jazz & blues.
One guitarist is good at metal, the other is good at rock music, and the keyboardist is good at everything but prefers jazz & blues or alternative rock.
The guitarists are good at playing jazz & blues, but are better in metal and rock.

There's a song that's inside of my soul
It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again
I'm awake in the infinite cold
But You sing to me over and over and over again

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands
and pray to be only Yours
I pray to be only Yours
I know now you're my only hope

Sing to me the song of the stars
Of Your galaxy dancing and laughing
and laughing again
When it feels like my dreams are so far
Sing to me of the plans that You have for me over again

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray
To be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I know now you're my only hope

I give You my destiny
I'm giving You all of me
I want Your symphony
Singing in all that I am
At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back

I'm just beginning to play the violin, but I'm running into some problems with my fingernails on my left hand.

As is well known, shortened fingernails are the way to go. But for some reason no matter how much I clip them, the nails on my hand are still not short enough! I think I even clipped them a little too much because too much of the finger below the nail is exposed.

Even with all the whites of the nails clipped off, the padding on my fingertips do not extend past my fingernail enough. I have provided some images to make what I'm trying to describe more clear.

http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/2493/fingerry1.jpg

Does anyone know what I need to do to make the padding of my fingertips extend past my shortened fingernails?

P.S. This problem also plagued me during my piano studies, as no matter how much I clipped my nails you could hear them click click clicking on the piano.
Just to clarify, even clipped all the way when I tap on a hard surface my fingers mostly vertically I can still hear the nails. Seems the padding of my fingertips is not big enough  or something.
But that's only when I'm tapping perfectly vertically... If I tap about 30 degrees to the side then my nails don't contact the surface. Is this okay? I had always thought playing the violin requires fingers to be pressing on the strings almost vertically.
