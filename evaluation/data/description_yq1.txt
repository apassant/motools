 I was watching the spanish channel and I saw a great song.  The guy looks very similar to Mark Anthony but its not him.  It sounds like a love song.  He is sing the song to a girl and there are scenes with him holding her and there are also seens of her in her underwear on the pool table and he's over her.  The song ends by him walking away from a cemetery.  SOme of the lyrics are (and they might be off and mispelled):  \"suerte loco\" \" di me que sido\"\nAlso, its a solo song.  Not regaeeton or regaee.  Another detail....there are moments in the music video that the male singer is in a straight jacket.

 Does it annoy anyone else when it seems like music these days are just a trend and people just listen to a particular song to act cool?  Also it what\u2019s annoying is that people  limit themselves to just one type of music and act as if it\u2019s illegal to listen to any other genre and they get embarrassed if they listen to another song that\u2019s not of their specific genre...\nSeriously music should not be about what\u2019s cool or not it should be about what you like...what do you guys think?\nOh yeah one more thing that is also annoying is that I noticed these days you get these annoying whiny little 13 year old girls that say they love a band and it\u2019s their favourite band and they\u2019re the bands  biggest fan just because they have a crush on one of the band members that is such a annoying!!! >.<\n\nNo offence to the people who aren\u2019t like that, but you know what I mean...

 I and some of my friends think about starting a band.\nI play the drums, two of my friends play the guitar & another plays the keyboard.\nWe tried to play freestyle together one day, and we created a lot of great ideas. However, we didn't seem to be able to organize these ideas into one smooth flowing song.\nWe had good chemistry between each other while we improvised, but when we started composing a song, it looked like we got lost in our own ideas.\n\nNote that we can play anything from soft classical rock to hardcore metal, as well as jazz & blues.\nOne guitarist is good at metal, the other is good at rock music, and the keyboardist is good at everything but prefers jazz & blues or alternative rock.\nThe guitarists are good at playing jazz & blues, but are better in metal and rock.\n\nWhat genre should we play??\n& what can we do to coordinate our efforts efficiently??\n\nPLZ HELP!

 Hi all,\n\nI'm just beginning to play the violin, but I'm running into some problems with my fingernails on my left hand.\n\nAs is well known, shortened fingernails are the way to go. But for some reason no matter how much I clip them, the nails on my hand are still not short enough! I think I even clipped them a little too much because too much of the finger below the nail is exposed.\n\nEven with all the whites of the nails clipped off, the padding on my fingertips do not extend past my fingernail enough. I have provided some images to make what I'm trying to describe more clear.\n\nhttp://img136.imageshack.us/img136/2493/fingerry1.jpg\n\nDoes anyone know what I need to do to make the padding of my fingertips extend past my shortened fingernails?\n\nP.S. This problem also plagued me during my piano studies, as no matter how much I clipped my nails you could hear them click click clicking on the piano.\nJust to clarify, even clipped all the way when I tap on a hard surface my fingers mostly vertically I can still hear the nails. Seems the padding of my fingertips is not big enough  or something.\nBut that's only when I'm tapping perfectly vertically... If I tap about 30 degrees to the side then my nails don't contact the surface. Is this okay? I had always thought playing the violin requires fingers to be pressing on the strings almost vertically.

 From what I can remember the song in question is from an obscure 90's SKA band ( take this with a grain of salt I'm working from memory here)  the only lyric I can recall is the following \"Oh Baby. I get so lonely. I get so lonely. That I needed you by my side...\"  I believe there was a music video for the song too it took place in a car wash or something.

Anyone know of a great song for this time in our lives?  My mom, jokingly, suggested \"Leaving On a Jet Plane\".  lol\nHe will be missed in every aspect of the word.  I'll miss him as a husband, as a father to our children, as a friend, as a lover.....

 My Fender Starcaster distortion pedal (yeah, I know it's cheap; $50 at Target) is acting up. I usually use the wall adapter for it instead of a 9v battery because it makes a tighter, more concentrated distortion tone. But, as of this morning, the stupid adapter isn't working. I tried with another adapter, hoping it was just the adapter that was messed up, but it stilll didn't work. I like the pedal, even though it's dirt cheap, and I'm not willing to buy another one (I'm saving up for a $900 Ibanez right now). Any suggestions on how to get it working again? Please????

 Hello! \n\nThere's this song, and I don't know why, but I think it's called \"Let it Run\". I don't know the artist's name, but I do know it's a woman that sings it. It starts off a little exotic, like a woman chanting, and it repeats near the end. The chorus goes something like \"let it ruuun\" or something like that. The singer has a sweet voice. I've searched it everywhere online but can't find it. It's not by Electric Light Orchestra. It's not new, but its not old either. \n\nI'm hoping you can help me!  \n\nThank you,  
 http://youtube.com/watch?v=6P0a8ngoqCI\n\nopinions?\nfirst its fabolous, then its santana the great, THEN weezy\njuelz said, \"obey me like peasants\"\n\nLOL\nlol, sorry I've been under a rock lately  
 It is sung by a guy and and I think it goes Everytime I close my eyes, she's the one......can't remember the rest help!  
   
 It goes something like this...\n\nTu tu ru (clap, clap, clap) and it was pretty repetitive. :)\n\nIt's driving me nuts!\nNo, it's not the Chicken Dance. It's a popular 80s instrumental song. It's very electronic.  
 I Need A Songwriter/Composer,A Manager, A Producer. Where Can I Get These/For Long time Album Production...?  
 I know, I know, it's a weird thing to ask for, but it's been driving me nuts. If you must know why, it because I like to go on roleplaying forums, and I wanted a \"theme song\" for one of my plant-manipulating characters. The problem is that the character has a kind of peppy personality, but all songs that I think are very plant-related, such as John Denver's Garden Song (very good song) are too slow and mellow. So I'm asking you guys out there if you can name a song or two that would fit those specifications. Thanks!  
 i really like the song baby dont go by fabulus but i really want to know more songs like it.. i guess i just like its beeet yeah so please help  
 Please tell me what's the names of the songs starting at 00:15 and 5:32 (for cat walk)!\n\nhttp://tw.youtube.com/watch?v=PvyDFpTQrNw\n\nThank you in advance ^___^

 Has it deteriorated as much as I think it has in the last 5 years? (I got sick of hearning mofos talk about their rims and hotel lobbies B.S and that was it for me)\n\nSo has it become crap since the days of Tupac, Biggie, early Nas, earlier Jay-z, etc. ?\nYour thoughts please.

 Okay so I'm 15 and I'm auditioning for a local singing competition. I REALLY need some help choosing a great song. I really love pop, but I think I sound better doing country. So any pop/country songs? NO taylor Swift, please. I love her music, but she is wayyyy over-played. I want an original song that will really show off my vocals, but that I will still feel comfortable. I wanted to do Miranda Lambert, but I'm not sure her songs are very appropriate for this kind of competition. Please pick songs that don't curse or anything. I'm VERY outgoing and I like to run around the stage and junk, so I need  a good get-up-n-dance type of song. haha. Ummm need additional details? Just ask.\nThanks so much for your help!\nLater taters  
 There's this rap song, where there is someone rapping. While he is rapping, this guy in the background says \"hold on\" and when the chorus starts, he sings \"I sing on for all of you\" I think. Does anyone know who wrote this song and what it's called?

 the follow up to Little Brothers Get back album...the alubm/mixtape and Justus For All? If you've heard it, did you enjoy it? good? bad? indifferent?  
   
 Tough break about jon, huh!  
 So I\u2019ve been playing for 6 or 7 months now and I\u2019m not an exceptional player, but I do enjoy it. If the teachers asks me to play on my own and there is no one to guide me and I\u2019m supposed to keep count of the rhythm/beat of the song, and there is no other sound around, I start to hear the music in my head and then I\u2019m not counting but listening to the song in my head and then changing when the song changes. Is it like that for everybody? Why does this happen?\nThank you  
 \nthanks Gear M loved that song! x  
 Okay, so I have a husband of 5 years, and even though it should not bother me that other females like him- logically and honestly it sure does. So he had this ex that I have had several encounters with since we got together at the beginning, she cant seem to MOVE ON. She recently dedicated this song to him. You Oughta Know by Alanis Morissette. I know it seems stupid to want to be able to find a song to match this, for some people but I would like to find one that explains this here- that she is just what she is nothing but the past, hes with me now and she is jealous . I have heard that I know by Sunday, however thats from way back when Soul Train days and its hard to find it. So something that explains what I want to explain to her. Any suggestions?

 Hi,\n\nMy name's Brittany (Britt) and I'm 15. In chorus at school, I'm a 1st soprano and everyone knows I can sing well like that - I've been in chamber choirs for 5 years. But, I've never let anyone here my lower \"belting voice\". I'm afraid it might just be interpreted as shouting. Could you tell me how I sound?\n\nhttp://www.soundupload.com/audio/x51typ1ce08fa5a\n\nI had to stand in the hallway to make it bearable, hopefully it's not too loud. Please let me know if I should keep this inside of me.  
 it goes something like SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKE A SHAKE IT and it does that for like 3 times. i have no idea who sings it and thats all. can you help me out?  
 i dont know what the song is called and trying to find it  
 I love this song although I havent heard it very much.  Its got some crazy sounding pianao/keyboard... I looked it up online and couldnt find matches. Its a guy who sings it...does anyone knw what song I'm talking about and who sings it?  Thank you so much!  :)

 i want to download music with out da instruments just da words\nhip hop music..........  
 I remembered getting this CD in some deal with Columbia House way back where you get all kinds of CD's for penny or something, only because I liked the cover.  The CD was ok compared to today's BS hip-hop, but horrible compared to the hip-hop that was coming out back then.  Somebody asked a question about wack albums with hot covers, I remembered it, and thought I'd see if anybody else remembered it.\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9f/Big_Bear_'Doin_Thangs'_Album_Cover.jpg  
 To me, it has always been a wide-ranging term which served to encompass various subgenres. Just like Rock covers genres from Krautrock to Hard Rock, Alternative Rock serves as a means to group various subgenres; Post-Punk, Shoegazing, Noise Rock, Grunge etc.\n\nBut now I'm starting to think it's just a meaningless label.\nA fellow user once said that Sonic Youth didn't seem heavy enough to be Alternative. Another user earlier today called Disturbed and Metallica Alternative Rock. These days, when people ask for Alternative bands, they often get bands like Fall Out Boy.\n\nFrom this, one can tell that different people have very different views as to what Alternative Music really is.\n\nSo the question I pose is this; What is 'Alternative Rock' to you?\nDo you think it is a valid sub-genre at all?\n+ You can add any additional thoughts you have on the matter.  
 ok the comercial was like a band playing and some wierd animated thing was around them.  something like a windows media player visual thing. if u can give me who the comerciall that would be fine. youtube video even better!! thanks

 okay, I know this might be hard to figure out but, I hope someone can help me... I was watching VH1 this morning and I heard this song by some guy... I don't know how the words go but I do know in the video the guy is wearing an orange shirt and he is an older guy probably in his 30's with brown hair.  He kinda has a raspy voice, sound kind of rock starish! \nIts driving me insane I need to know who sings this song... Please Help!

 Regarding the treatment of early soviet modernist composers (Roslavets, Lourie, Prokofiev...) and their ideals, how did this affect the ideals and music of the next generation of composers? (Shostakovich, Shebalin, Shaporin and even as far as Khachaturian and Kabalevsky if valid).\n\nAny reading reccommendations would be well recieved, as I am fascinated in Russian history, and would love to learn more!

 I have a Laney kickback amp(not exactly sure what model) that has been acting up for awhile. When I play, the sound kind of randomly jumps in and out or gets softer or not even make a noise. Out of frustration, I've solved it temporarily by either smacking the strings above my pickups or kicking the amp. Sometimes it just has like a really loud buzz/shriek, kind of like   the sound of a loose guitar cable with an amp on, that completely overpowers my bass and I have to turn it off to stop. I don't think it's my basses since it does it for all of them, and my cables are pretty new. What can I do with the amp to fix it, or should I take it in to a shop?  
 I CHECK LIMEWIRE NOTHING THERE!!!\nI PREFER ZSHARE RAPIDSHARE MEGAUPLOAD LIMELINX!!!\nPLEASE HELP!!!  
 I like the song can you also show me a website that i could download it for free  
 But I do remember at the beginning it had sirens blaring and its not a hip-hop song or anything its like a cross between maybe metal and rock or something. I can't remember anything about the song other then I like it. I hate when stuff like this happens. Any help please?\n=O I said rock not country. Don't bring your blasphemous country to this question!

 I made an acoustic guitar out of a shoe box and some rubber bands that sounds good, but it isn't very loud. I have a little mike that is alright for capturing audio and a battery powered speaker that I want to hook together. Other people have told me that I need an amp between the mike and speaker, but I don't really know anything besides an amp makes the signal from the mike to the speaker bigger. Any ideas besides buying a small amp from radio shack or somewhere?\n\nI have another idea, but I don't know if it will work. Would putting a handheld phone inside the box and having the wires that would have gone to the speaker in the phone go to another speaker work?\n\nMaybe a small megaphone or something would work, too.  
 If you don't know them,they are a band that yells

 \"Have A Cigar\" on the \"Wish you Were Here\" album?\nIt's Roy Harper who is 67 today!\n\nMQ; What other songs from studio albums have a \"guest\" (other than the usual lead vocalist) singing the lead vocals?\nEdit: Smiley, I knew you and a few others would know, so can you answer MQ?\nEdit: Press C, It only counts if he sings the lead vocals on the studio album.\nEdit: Kenny A, Roy Harper doesn't sing on that song, it's a tribute to him.  Jimmy Page though has appeared on Roy's albums \"Stormcock\" and \"Whatever Happened to Jugula?\".\nEdit: Peepaw, sorry, duets don't count here, Lol.\nEdit: Terry, Thanks, that's a great pick!\nEdit: Smiley, Duets don't count and Frank Zappa had guest vocalists on nearly all his albums.\nI know you can do better, Lol!\nEdit: Smiley, I was talking about the Sandy Denny duet only!\nEdit: Cookie Cutter, Great answer!\nI have that Nugent album and didn't realize that.

 Who hates Taylor Swift besides me and think she sounds totally fake as a country singer? \n\nOk, my real question iiiiiiiiis:\nIs there a website where you can download or just listen to instrumental versions of popular songs?\nIf you don't believe she sounds fake, listen to her song, Our Song.

 i've listened to the music Mike has made with Fort Minor and i think it's awsome. are there ANY rappers like him today?\ni'm tired of listening to this mainstream crap. i don't want to listen to guys wanting to having sex with girls, selling drugs, or gang wars. the only other rapper i can think of who actually has talent is Eminem  
 In my opinion posers like Slipknot should not even be allowed to be anywhere near the metal genre, and basically any of the nu metal bullshit. Can you think of any band like that ?\nI think that ACDC, Guns N Roses and Led Zeppelin are more metal then any of the nu metal bands, and they are considered the original metal bands.\nLone Wolf, who the f uck gives a s hit about the Grammys? Iron Maiden never won one f-ing grammy and they are still my favorite band. Popularity is not what makes a true kick ass metal band.\nWhat do you mean what about black sabbath?\nOf Course I forgot Black Sabbath as the fathers of metal. Yea, they were one of the bands who made metal a genre. Also Jimi Hendrix, and many more

 I'm not sure if this is the right category to post this question or not, but I'm curious to ask anyway.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about cover songs -- when a band records/performs a song that was originally written/performed by someone else.  In particular, what cover songs do you know where the COVER version is more well-known than the original.\n\nSome examples:\n- Sh-boom:  originally recorded by the Chords, but better known in its version by the Crew Cuts (both from 1954, I think??)\n- When a Man Loves a Woman:  by Percy Sledge (1966), but (arguably) better known today in the remake by Michael Bolton (1991)\n- Red Rubber Ball:  written by Paul Simon, but recorded by The Cyrkle in 1966.  Interestingly, Simon and Garfunkel made a live recording of this song (on the \"Simon and Garfunkel: Old Friends\" collection)...is THIS a cover?  Did Paul Simon \"cover\" his own song?\n\nIf anyone knows of any other songs in this category, I'd love to hear them!\nKatydint -- Oh no!  Not BETTER.  I despise Michael Bolton.  But I'm suggesting that his recording might be more WELL-KNOWN than Sledge.  (I have no statistics to back that up, other than that I've heard Bolton's version on the radio much more often...)  
 i think its by bob dylan but it goes like this:\n\noooooo weee ride behind tomorrows the day my brides are gonna come oh no we gotta go down in my easy chair          \n\nthen the harmonica plays???\nthank you so much!!!!!!!!! my dad used to sing that all the time! you made my day!  
 \nHere's an interview from the other day where he mentions it..\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqQ3RFMIJtU\nI only wrote this to try annoy people BTW  
 An 80's band (I think) had a song out, soft rock.  I don't know the lyrics, but I think the beginning line and chorus have the words/sounds \"oooo  yeah yeah\"  with the 'oooo' drawn out and the 'yeah yeah' sounded quickly.\nThanks !  
 and what is one of their songs you like/listening to right now.\n\nmine is papa roach and their song 'forever'\nive just started listening to them. they rock!  
   
 Hello,\n\nI am going to buy a students trumpet, more precisely a Jean Baptiste 680.  Now I have the option to get it with silver finish, or lacquered a nice blue or black.   I am concerned that the laqure may effect the sound in some way.  Does anyone know how big a difference there may be?  \n\nAlso if some one can may recommend another trumpet in the $400- $800 dollar range I would love to go look for other options. \n\nThanks\nalso i understand that laqure fades.. how much should i expect?  
 if you know any names of the songs in Apr\u00E8s lui i would love to know. thanks  
 Yeah so i do choir and plays and singing competitions and all of that stuff and people say that i have a really good pure sounding voice but when i try to listen to myself sing i feel like its nothing special..Im trying to get more comfortable with my singing because im still trying to overcome stage fright.

 some ppl i talked to, they got all mad when i tried to figure out what genres certain bands are in.\n\ni was trying to figure out what bands were death metal bands and what were the metalcore bands.\n\ni was just asking and they acted like i was insulting their favorite death metal bands (which i wasnt)

 I want to know about your point of view as a real Rock 'N' Roll fan and evaluator . I have three questions about JEFF BECK :\n\n(1) Did Jeff Beck betray his own talent by focusing so much on innovation and perfection especially in his solo career instead of being an alien guitarist like Jimmy Page or Eric Clapton ??\n\n(2) For the sake of arguement , if Jeff Beck had his own band after the disbanding of JEFF BECK GROUP and this band he had included talented vocalist , bassist and drummer . What would happen then ? Will he challenge or beat Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd ...etc. ??\n\n(3) Are you satisfied as a Rock fan with the outcome of Jeff Beck obsession with innovation and not bands . I mean do you like his shift from (Blues , Hard Rock) into (Fusion , Jazz , Virtuoso) ?????

Is it like that for everybody? Why does this happen?\nThank you

 If our love was a fairy tale\nI would charge in and rescue u\nOn a yacht baby we would sail\nTo an island where we'd say I do\n\nAnd if we had babies they would look like u\nIt'd be so beautiful if that came true\nYou don't even know how very special you are\n\nYou leave me breathless\nYou're everything good in my life\nYou leave me breathless\nI still can't believe that you're mine\nYou just walked out of one of my dreams\nSo beautiful you're leaving me\nBreathless\n\nAnd if our love was a story book\nWe would meet on the very first page\nThe last chapter would be about\nHow I'm thankful for the life we've made\n\nAnd if we had babies they would have your eyes\nI would fall deeper watching you give life\nYou don't even know how very special you are\n\nYou must have been sent from heaven to earth to change me\nYou're like an angel\nThe thing that I feel is stronger than love believe me\nYou're something special\nI only hope that I'll one day deserve what you've given me\nBut all I can do is try\nEvery day of my life

 I am a student filmmaker and I plan to have someone play one of Fernando Sor's pieces on a guitar. I was wondering if there is any copyright issue. Or is it free license, or whatever the term is...

 I believe the worst offender is Sean Combs' (I'm going to call him this to avoid confusion lol) 2006 album Press Play. The album cover:\n\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/15/Diddy_-_Press_Play.jpg\n\n...has a cool, sinister science fiction edge. But the album itself is dull. Solid production on poor songs.

 I have just heard that Coldplay are to 'beam' their latest album into space.  Yes, that's right, their new album is to be played on Friday and beamed through space.  What is the point of this?  Apart from obviously boosting awareness of Coldplay through the alien community.  Will this boost record sales for them and is this cheating in the charts if the album is not bought on Earth??\n\nWhen is this man going to be sectioned?  Naming his child Apple and now playing an album through space

 lately new artists have been modernizing music from the past. since i'm not nearly old enough to identify this type of music i need help. this entire album is very cliche[if i'm using this word correctly], even the lyrics are. so i'm gonna give you a link to where you can listen to the song that i feel is the most representational of the style of music i'm  talking about..\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkgbNpdR4HQ\n\ni think the first part of the song is going to be most helpful compared to the rest of it. like i said i'm way to young to know about this period in time. but it gives me that 'original new york city gangster from back in the day' kind of idea.

 I'm a student in University studying Spanish and I'm doing a conversation class project. The theme is an argument by two backpackers who have gone all through South America and they have an argument because one of them has all his things and the other one has discovered that almost everything he has has gradually disappeared...\n\nI had this really odd idea this morning that it might be fun to do this as a 'musical' and I realized it would be a lot of work... We've only got two or three days to work on this, but I thought it might be fun to do a voice over for Bohemian Rhapsody which has a pretty good variety of paces for a good ripping argument... \n\nQuestion is, where could I find a good quality version of the song that isn't a \"Karaoke Toy Electric Piano\" version but that also doesn't have any vocals... I want control over the pausing which may not match the original and I don't want to pause and have Freddie singing away...\n\nThanks...\nIncidentally, I am open to 'download' options since this is an educational project and I am relatively sure that this is covered by 'fair use' (and I'm not even in America anyhow).\n\nI'd check the torrents but I don't really know where to start... \n\nShould I be looking at Karaoke versions? Are there Karaoke versions that feature higher quality than others?\n\nWhat would I look for?\nyeah, I saw that link too... it's actually a broken link... #1 on the list from google. yay.\nhttp://www.karaoke-version.com/en/mp3-backingtrack/queen/bohemian-rhapsody.html\n\nfeatures a nice example of what I am not looking for... this one even has TWO toy electric pianos. woo.  
 I have the tightest lyrics out of my friends and family\nand rap style but my voice is too deep and loud\nand slow it doesn't match with my lyrics how do I\nchange it up can I go to a signing class or other?  
 And who do you like better, overall?  
 I just saw the video clip, and it shows all this violence between civilians i guess and the police?

So what's with her smashing the glass and that? People dancing around and the police? I getting mixed intepretations.. Any help?\n\nOh and what does this mean?\n\n'I am the left eye\nyou're the right\nWould it not be madness to fight\nWe come one'\n\n10 points for best answer. Any help would be very much appreciated.

 I recently saw a video of a band from Australia or New Zealand (or an island close by there). The song was kind of fusion / jazz / pop.\n\nThe lead male singer was a good looking island type guy. He was brown / dark skinned with chisled features. I believe he might be Maori. He's good looking enough to be a model. He was wearing a kind of black wool skull cap. I think he wears them in a couple of their videos. \n\nI believe this was a fairly new song / video. The video is also on youtube somewhere.\n\nAnyone know the name of the band?

 Sort of like \"This Desert Life\" by Counting Crows, like the Raconteurs, Vampire Weekend, Jason Webley, Eliot Morris.. etc.\nAs well as some slower stuff like Kings of Convenience, Ferraby Lionheart, Grand Archives and the like. \n\nSo...

 Preferably their style is kinda \"power metal-esque\" or \"melodeath metal-esque\" or \"symphonic metal\".\n\nNo metalcore and nu-metal please.\n\nThanks in advance!!\ncoldenhas - I knew what you mean.

 I THINK it might be an ad for Queensland or Tasmania tourism or something, but I'm not sure. I kind of tune out and just listen to the song. Haven't seen the ad in a while, and I'd really like to know what the song was, if anyone has any idea what ad I'm talking about.\nI don't think it was that. The singer was female, and the song was very soft and calm.  
   
   
 If so how was it? Which one was it West Covina or Huntington Park? What is the dress code like for men? How is the crowd and environment??

 Does it have to do with mouth position, tongue position, or a combination of both? How do you, as a singer, do this?  
 OK, so I need some punk-bands to listen too. I love bands like The Clash. Any suggestions?

 I got a electric guitar and amp (Ashton) about 2 months ago.I use it sometimes and i dont take lessons.I just print guitar tabs from the internet and practise them.Im kinda new to amps and guitars and i was wondering:\nWhen i strum a string is the sound supposed to keep coming out of the amp for as long as the sting is vibrating?Because when i strum a string once the sound of it would last about  2 minutes if i just let the string keep vibrating.When i play a tune and i strum a new string the sound from the new string is being drowned out from the sound of the previous string.Its really annoying and the tune doesnt sound clear.Is this supposed to happen?I thought that if i strum a new string the sound from the previous string would be cut off.\nThnx for any help.

 Ok, this one is tough.  It was on the grocery store Muzak.  It has a slow verse, with little or no drums, and an upbeat chorus that has drums.  \n\nIt sounds like late 70s or early 80s.  The chorus lyrics I can hardly remember but they repeat a few lines, something first, then something about \"you always knew me the best\" or similar.\n\nIt sounds like a sort of average early 80s light rock style band a-la Ambrosia, Player, Boz Skaggs, something along those lines.  Throw out anything you can think of please, it's driving me nuts.\nRo-Vale, how the HELL did you figure it out?  The details I gave were totally wrong, and the lines weren't even from the chorus?  WOW!\n\nWell, thanks, it's the right song.\nOh, no, it's not the right song, but it triggered the right song in my head.  It was very close.  The song I'm thinking of should be easier to find, I was able to write out the melody and now I'll just post it up and see who recognises it.  
 If you guys could help me out that would be friggin awesome =D all i need is a list of good hip hop/rap songs that i can just sit down, chill and listen to through my mp3 player. Thank you all.

 1) What is the song Stan by Eminem really about?\n\n2) What is the best mixtape of alltime?\n\n3) What is Juelz Santana's best album?\n\n4) When does King Mathers come out?  
 I'm in need of some songs that kind of have the 'i miss you'/'am i good enough for you' feel to them. i generally like anything except rap and most hip hop. thanks so much :)  
 So I suddenly can't remember this song...but I know some of the lyrics go somewhat like this:\n\nI've been searching for a reason...\n....whole life through and through...\n\nblah blah blah, those 2 lines don't necessarily go together, but those are the only 2 I could remember, it's not one of the \"newer\" songs and I remember seeing it somewhere in a movie...\n\nand this is kinda random, but does anyone know what the ending song to Prince Caspian is? The part where Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are returning to the real word...\nnope its not the reason, thanks though. =)  
 anyone know have any idea what this song is called/who does it?  
   
 i need an R&B song about your girl talking or being with another guy. Does anyone know any good ones?  
 It's different than knowing the repertoire of a rock band, you know who is singing those songs and can look up where the band is playing. \n\nFor what it's worth, I would like to find out if anyone in my area (north of Houston) is performing John Rutter's Requiem...  
 in this video there is a horn in the begining http://video.aol.com/video-detail/baby-bash-feat-hurricane-chris-gorilla-zoe-cyclone-remix/2571713812 where can i find it and other sound effects. I am a dj and any help would be great!  
 I just wanted to know more before considering joining.  
 Does anybody want me to mix them some songs??\n\nPut the Artist's name followed by the Name of the track.\n\ni.e.\n\nDaft Punk - One More time\n\nIt can be House/Techno/Electro/ & Hip Hop\n\nIf you want more then 5 tracks mixed message me YAHOO: dekoi_9\n\n-dj deko!\nDisco/70's/80's/90's  
 I only know the lyrics\nthe base is loud the disco light shining through the crowed\n(chorus)the night is young dont let em turn on the lights\nlet us decide when they play that last song\n\no theres something on the surface right now\n\n\n\nand thats all i know\nplease give me the song name and artist  
 I'm starting to get pretty bored with the music I'm listening to. Does anyone know some fun songs that are kinda like stuff by Metro Station, Forever the Sickest Kids, We the Kings, and The Dangerous Summer?\n\nIf you could, could you say your favorite songs that are kinda like that?\n\nThanks.
