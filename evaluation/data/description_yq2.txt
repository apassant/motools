 Chris Brown - Heart aint a brain? A happy ending makes it right..... or A happy ending makes you cry?? I just found the second one and I think that this is the right one.

 In the subreal reality Between suburban and reality I don't take kindly when your speaking to me You should just go, you should go now Aniexty is slipping in, and thought I could get some peace agian But no more, no more now, no no more now Summer has come and gone Now the hell has come rolled along Now I'm sweating bullets just cause For unjust cause, I'm dreaming for an unjust cause Try to do emotional trade off, but your only left with emotional scars Emotianal Scars and emotional  Try anything you wanna do  As long it leads me closer to you I'm breaking down, I'm going down Staying up all night Trying to shake away demons that live inside Let's go away, let's go away Sleeping pills in one hand This never works out the way I planned Always fails...Always fails Anyway you want to go As long it's not doing anything I'm tired of this stupid game Stupid game called aniexty I'm tired and pissed your messing with me And anything you wanna do Tell ya what I'm not getting closer to you I'm too self centered, yeah too self centered  And everything's gotta go Rollback on lifes little problem you know Yeah yeah we all know, we know  Do whatever you wanna do I'm not getting closer to you Anexity, no it's anexity   And it's called anexity, I stole one line from birthday girl-with patrick stump singing...Uhh it's the one that says do anything you wanna do, but in the song he says, What is it we wanna do...so really it's just not sounding anything along the lines of that, I just drawed inspiration lol...My songwritting needs something else with it, I just don't know what...I can write really good metafores I just need to be really high, just kidding, I don't know have tips? lame...gosh, REPOST...

 Hey! I really love singing and its fun for me to sing. I'm also good (I think), but I don't really know since I've never sung to anyone before. I think I might want to be a singer eventually, but I get SO nervous when I have to do anything in front of an audience. Does anyone have any tips to work through this? I reallly want to show people that I can sing! Thank you guys! ^_^  
 Here's a mini-clip of me singing Power of Love by Celine Dion. It's a tiny bit loud, because I'm a little bit lazy and I can't be bothered to make it a little bit quieter... so just fiddle with the volume until it makes you happy. :D Sorry that the last word gets cut off, too--I can't really be bothered to fix that either... >.<;  Anyways, please give me constructive criticism. Any suggestions for hitting the high notes and making them sound decent?  http://youtube.com/watch?v=DCOL2CG_O8g  P.S. I realize that I am a guy singing Celine Dion, he he. If you don't like that... too bad?  
 Does a non remix version of And Then We Kiss by Britney Spears exist? The song is on the 2005 Remix Album, \"B in the mix\" and it's And Then We Kiss (Junkie XL). Does a normal version or demo exist?

 I heard it a few times before, but it doesn't appear anywhere on the internet... The only place I found was this: http://youtube.com/watch?v=BJQuvm7WetQ  Please tell me if you know the name of the song, the artist, or a place in which i can hear it or download it.  Thank You!  
 I can't think of the name of this 90's country song.  The video showed a guy coming home to an empty house with a video of his woman drilling holes in his bowling ball and selling his jet ski for $50 among other damage to his many toys.  Does anyone remember the name of it?  
 dodedodedo dodedodedo dodododo dodododo dodedodedo  Its been stuck in my head.  It maybe classical music... not to sure. But I've heard it in arcades on the grabbers before so it's probably really old. if i had a sound clip i could probably work out what it is.  Its got a tinkling sound in the background and may have been played on the keyboard.  I'm not even sure if it has lyrics, especially as its just the intro.  
 How do you pronounce Johnny's last name?  
 It had characters dressed like they were in robin hood times. The scruffy haired lead singer was walking along a trail to a farmhouse leading on to a county fair, accompaning him was a dancing midget dressed like a jester. The song he was belting out was very new wave and the part I remember was; \"We can dance, we can dance...\"   Anyone know the singer and the song? \"We can dance, we can dance\" has been playing at the back of my mind for two decades now.  
 i think its an amazing song  
 Manuel de Falla(1876-1946): one of if not the greatest of Spanish composers, in my opinion.      What about yours?  Are you familiar with him and any of his works?  Do you know of significant contributions he made to world culture/history, other than his compositions?      Or, if you are not familiar with him, are there any particular questions that you would like to ask of those who are, and respond subsequent to your posting a question?      I love his music, and consider some to be indisputeable master-pieces; but will leave to those who might agree, to identify and elaborate on why he and his contributions are significant, and are deserving of a much greater exposure on this forum.       Please feel free to offer any criticizms - positive or negative - with regards to my format of this topic.      And please, list your nominee(s)which you think would be a good composer to be considered on this series.                                                      Alberich

 Hey, i have downloaded The Version 7 of pantera - walk for guitar pro..It has 5 stars by 16 people who rated it. it's appearnlty the most correct tab for the song..   This is Pantera's Lead guitarplayer playing the solo :  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0-OfXmVCVw  I don't think the version_7 for the guitar pro is a 5 stars correct and i think there are a few notes missing in this tab.. can someone put a link for the tab that is like the same or atleast Better than Version_7??  *A TAB FOR GUITAR PRO WILL HELP MUCH MORE THAN A NORMAL TAB *  Oh and make sure it's not a tab for the newest guitar pro version!  Thanks

 This question will make perfect sense to those who understand.  
 it goes like  it was a gift from the heavens it was easy to tell it was love from above that can save me from hell  
 Just another boring night, and i decided to write a song, its quite a random song about driving through an Arizona desert. tell me what you think please, i sort of had a Doors rhythem in mind for it.   Red Skies A dusky sundown on an Arizona freeway, driving lonely on a hot summers day. A vastness of orange desert without the slightest sound., not a chance of life for miles around. The red skies glow with glory, a road taking me into a fairytale story.  (Music slows down) Why, I say. What a beautiful Arizona day. Sand whiter than  the whiteness of salt lake, The remoteness of this road, sends freedom my way. I own this road, for gods sake.   (Instrumental)  The roadsides lined with cacti for miles,  At speeds so fast they become nothing but green walls with yellow tiles. The sun is half cut beneath a mighty dune, when its gone, it\u2019ll be replaced by a cole desert moon.  (Music slows down) Why, I say. What a beautiful Arizona day. Sand whiter than the whiteness of salt lake, The remoteness of this road, sends freedom my way. I own this road, for gods sake.   (Instrumental until end)  
 female singer, acoustic, 6-8 timing, first words are \"what is your passion\" then maybe something about cirlces?  
 I've been looking at amazon and itunes, they do have AKFG at amazon but they have the cd's, I am looking for some of AKFG's singles like Loop&Loop. Any idea where to find them?  
 I'm certain I couldn't have made this up, but I've been asking around & searching for awhile..  Had to have been between 00'-04'.. I can't remember who the group was, or anything about the song really, but in the music video there was a visual of an alarm clock showing \"12:08\". I don't think it was a line of the lyrics (I've searched and found nothing) but I believe there were subtitles that said \"12:08, Our Last Goodbye\". That's the part thats important to me and the only thing that truely stands out. For the longest time I thought it was an Incubus song, but when I actually looked into it & tried to look it up, that was a completely different song. From what I remember it was an all male group (Not an individual singer) Pop/Alt/whatever you want to call the genre.. I saw the video on MTV or VH1.  If anyone knows what I'm talking about I would GREATLY appreciate any info. This has been in the back of my mind for years LOL. I need to know this memory actually exists :P  THANK YOU  
   
   
 The song is Doll by Daphne Khoo.  
 Okay it's like this, whenever I sing high notes, my throat gets itchy that I have to stop singing. It's like I'm going to choke if I didn't stop. I just want to know, why is it itching and what should I do to prevent it from happening? Thanks for those who'll answer. =]  
 On BBC 1 right now 11:32 am wednesday. There was some music playing in the background as they were looking in an Italian town. What is it. It's driving me mad. I can't find out what it's called. What's \"cats in the cradle\"? is it the artist or the tune? It was the music that was on very near the start of the program You must have all missed it. It isn't \"cats in the cradle\"

I don't know what the song is or who wrote it, but can you give me the details of the song with these lyrics... (not very accurate, this is vaguely what I remember of it) \"Love won't wait, no love won't wait, you keep your hands in your pockets, no it's much too late...\" I know that is probably not the exact lyrics, but please provide me with the name and artist!?  
   
 I'm playing the prestissimo movement from Beethoven's sonata in F minor op.2.  I think I've made a mistake in playing it separately in three sections because when I put it all together I can't get through it without feeling intense fatigue.  The middle section doesn't include these triplet figures in the bass so I can use that to rest my wrists.  I intent to slow it down to a reasonable pace when I can play right through without fatigue...But what happens then?  Do I gradually speed it up again?  Tips greatly appreciated. Sorry, it slipped my mind to actually state that I'm a pianist!  
 can you give me the kinds of music and songs for each kind?thankssss

 Many years ago I was interested in learning the drums and the teacher showed me the \"orthodox grip\" I was uncomfortable, it felt weird and I asked why I couldn't grip the same with both hands. He said because that is how you HAVE to hold the stick with your left hand. So I gave up. Later I saw bands playing with the more \"natural grip\" with both hands. Why do people still teach this ludicrous \"orthodox grip\" this was invented when drums were worn on the left side when marching. This makes sense. But to use the same grip when the drums are situated in front of you seems stupid. Why would a teacher insist on you learning \"orthodox grip\" when it's not necessary? bang went my drumming career. Pardon the pun.

 i am doin a project in school and i need to pick 20 music albums any suggestions, not allowed to be compilations  
   
 Okay, I was in a pub the other day with one of those jukebox music vids in the background. There were 2 songs on by what looked like the same band and I really can't remember what the song was - It looked like some Emo-version of McFly who were playing on a table whilst a seance was being held and the band were the ghosts so no one else could see them. ANYWAY - Does anyone know what this band/video/song is so that I can get it again cos it was pretty much the only new song I've liked in a while. Don't remember any lyrics as such either :( Thanks guys, it WAS Elliot Minor - Parallel Worlds. Will vote best answer asap.  
 Just curious. I have the album, but i didnt play it much when i bought it.

 I'm trying to hunt down a song I've heard on the radio twice this week, on the pop/hiphop stations, but I'm always too far away from home to get on the computer and check their playlists - today, I was two hours away from cell reception up in the Rockies.  It sounds like it's from the late 90s - early 00s, female lyricist, and the only bit I can remember goes BOW BOW \"my body, something something, something something get on it.\"  I wish I could remember more of the lyrics. Nope, not Mariah Carey.  The beat is a lot deeper and stronger. No, it isn't any collaboration between Bow Wow and Ciara. The beat reminds me of Aaliyah's Somebody, so it was probably written by Timbaland.  
 What song was at the top of the charts on 4th March 1997?  
 I have always been the first to diss these things and their users but I have a lot of CDs and was looking for a stacker/changer and stumbled across a bunch of these CDDJ things. Are they wack, which ones are quality, what to look for, do they wreck your CDs etc. Any Help Appreciated.

 Listen  http://www.keystotherain.net/music/VisionsofJohanna.mp3  or Read it at  http://www.slopbucket.com/bob/lyrics/7vision.html  This is a very catchy tune.  A lot of Bob Dylan songs make sense if you have the patience to sit down and listen to what he is saying, and then think about it, and then listen again, and again.   What is this song about?  Tell me in one word, a sentence; or a line by line analyzation.  What is this song about?  
 Email me. I can write lyrics and I can sing.

 Hello fellow yahooians..  I was watching fuse the other day, and a song came on, I missed the Title and the Name of the band credits..   Its was an video, Split screen. One side was an kid, average american kid, what he was going through that day, and then second screen was this chinese kid working in a chinese factory.. and towards the end of the video it goes, things cost more than you think..   the only lyric i remember is this.. Im a moth to your light,  Im an insect trying to break out into the night   Okay, if anyone could tell me the name of the band or the name of the song, it would be so greatly appreciated!  seeing that i cant get the song out of my head, and cant find it online.. lol Thanks again, Ciao!

 For all you Beatles fans out there, can you hear that high pitched noise in \"A Day in the Life\" after the final crescendo? It sounds like when a piano is on, and it tends to hurt my ears, but according to Wikipedia, many people can't hear it, and is only audible to animals and young people.  It's located right before the repeating mumbo jumbo at the end. On the CD, it's located at 5:06. Sorry, not piano. I meant TV.  I'm really out of it, sorry. The thing is, if you don't have ears that can pick up high pitched noises, then you will physically be unable to hear it. I find that to be really interesting. So come back, and please tell me if you're able to hear it.  
 please if anyone can help please do!  
 recommend me some!

 here are the lyrics: What do you do when you've done all you can do?  What do you say when you've said all you can say?   Where do you go, who can you lean on, where do you turn.   I go to my secret place, and I worship at His feet.  Secret place, where He meets my ev'ry need.  Secret place, and I worship at His feet.  Secret place, where He meets my ev'ry need.   Have a little talk with Jesus, tell Him all about your troubles.  He will hear your cry, He'll answer by and by.

 what is the reason for slipknot to break up after their next tour and y are they band from AUSTRALIA???  
 I'm not so good with genre's, but what I'm after probably fits into goth somewhere. I only buy cd's so I dont want to take a guess and found out I dislike the band anyway.  I quite like London After Midnight but I haven't found anything similar  I cannot stand female singers [dislike the high pitch]. And I don't like growling Norwegian bands. I tried last.fm but none of the 'similar' artists were quite right.   Anyone recommend me some bands.. and enlighten me to what the specific genre is :D  Thanks.

 I have started to learn the guitar and i was just shown tabs by my tutor. I would only play a few songs really and was wondering if i could just learn how to play tabs of my favourite songs instead of learning the guitar properly. Would this work? Ok all im really looking for is if i just want to learn say 10 songs max as i would play any other songs really would it be ok just to learn them with tab?  
 the chorus is: im begging you for mercy why dont you release me

 As a beginner in piano lesson, do you think it's wise to buy a USB professional MIDI keyboard that you could attach to a computer/laptop first before investing thousands of dollars into a real piano? What about portable roll up piano...that's way much cheaper....?  If I'm not mistaken there was a time where I saw a foldable piano keyboard, where you could fold it up in a compact size meant for travel, does such thing exist?  
 I'm thinking of starting to rap but before I do you have to have the voice to rap and I just want some opinions from you to see if I have a voice that could start rapping..  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azk5SPJ7qiU  
 not to be mean, but i'm just making up a song about hobo's that is sung to \"there were ten green bottles hanging on the wall\" and i made four paragraphs but i need six more... any idea's???  here it is so far: There were ten drunk hobo\u2019s hanging on the wall, Ten bald, drunk hobo\u2019s hanging on the wall, And if one drunk hobo, should accidently fall, There\u2019d be nine drunk hobo\u2019s left hanging on the wall.  There were nine hippy hobo\u2019s dancing in the night, Nine hippy hobo\u2019s dancing through the night, And if one hippy hobo, should get beaten in a fight, There\u2019d be eight hippy hobo\u2019s dancing in the night.  There were eight little gay hobo\u2019s singing in a tree, Eight little gay hobo\u2019s singing up in the tree, And if one little gay hobo, should sing along to me, There\u2019d be seven little gay hobo\u2019s singing in a tree.  There were seven fat hobo\u2019s eating chocolate cake, Seven fat hobo\u2019s munching chocolate cake, And if one fat hobo, should eat a chocolate fake, There\u2019d be six fat the last line was supposed to be: there'd be six fat hono's eating chocolate cake

 Hi.  I wanted to know what was the song in Step Up 2: The Streets during the part where the crew receives a text from Missy about the The Street.  It was when Chase started leaving the Fundraiser.  I believe the song started right about when Andie received the text.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks!  
 The ad is was for core 2 duo processors, aired about 6 months ago, Ad shows dancing people that morph into other prople. The song goes something like \"move to (or groove to) a diferent soung (or song).\".. I could'nt exactly tell...the vocals of the singer (guy) sound like it coming from a small radio\" , I heard it again recently in a movie \"Mad Money\", there is a sean where Katie Holmes is wearing headphones and listening to this song, where she drops her purse in a paking lot. Thanks. Does anyone know what it's called and who sings it? playing in the backgound in this youtube video, while shooting the intel advert  http://youtube.com/watch?v=Sm2dv-eSdgw&feature=related  
 i have screwd in the tremelo bar in to my guitar (yamah eg112) but does not move up or down to change the pitch,it just moves anticlokwise  or clockwise which usually screws in and out the tremelo bar,what should i do? please help  
   
 It's a song that plays in You got Served and it also plays in American Pie Beta House  
 I heard them on capitalfm all the time...I believe the back story of the two girls is they met in a house of song writers...I have been thinking about this song for years.  The video is them walking down the street its very poppy like the sugababes.  
 It says \"you wanted to know if it would be alright if i let you stay one more night...but i cant because you're dangerous\" its a young female artist.  
 Ok I'm writing a chorus to a song and it goes along with the beat \"If we were a movie\" by Hannah Montana. Well this is how it goes. If you were the ocean  Id be sand If you were a country Id be land Here I am  Once again ___________ Before answering please make sure you have heard the chorus from \"If we were a movie\" by Hannah Montana. Thanks  
 They're kind of 80s hard rock/pop oriented, so PLEASE DON'T LISTEN if this isn't your thing.  They're just songs I recorded in my basement by myself, so don't judge them like professional band recordings-listen to the ONE instrument being used instead of thinking there should be others.  Tell which one you like best, and why? Thanks for any input. http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=367769118

 Its a techno song/dance song/trance...and it has a female singer, and the lyrics go something like this...  Lets get away far, away...(some thing something some thing)  Heaven and sun so bright. (Thats all i know of the lyrics, sorry)    Any help would be great

 you know the one made by Bukas Palad. Thank you  
 Go to youtube and type in \"Figure Skating Heros\" and click on the one from mhcBERTnEDDY. Listen to the song. Please tell me if you know. Don't suggest asking the mhcBERTnEDDY person because they don't talk.  
 It came out in the 90's. I heard it on an episode of Clueless. If you've seen the show it was in the episode where Cher dates the guy that smokes & the song was playing during the sleepover/all nighter they were having for him to stop smoking. It went soemthing like:  Some people have to be completely together Lovers devoted to each other forever Now I've got things to do & I've said before that I know you have too When I'm not there In spirit I'll be there  Nobody knows me as well as you do  It sounded kinda electronica-ish. I've looked for it on lyric websites, google, youtube & found nothing. Its a female singer Yay! thats it. Thanks. The one I was looking for was probably a remake though cause it had a female singer, but I'll search for that one some other time. The one I was looking for was a cover by some band called Hooverphonic.  
 it goes: Sell the kids for food Weather changes moods Spring is here again Reproductive glands  He\u2019s the one Who likes all our pretty songs And he likes to sing along And he likes to shoot his gun But he knows not what it means knows not what it means when I say yah  
 I heard this once, but i don't see how this can be true.  I am a woman w/ a naturally low voice (an \"alto\" - even though i'm not in a choir). I think my break point is really low and was wondering if there are any \"benchmarks\" to tell if it's \"normal\"?  
 A couple of years back I was dating a boy from Tunisia and we were always listening to one song, which was sort of a remix of britney spears 'oops i did it again'. I reeeeally wanna listen to the song again... Does someone know the title or the name of the singer of the song?  
 I have been searching everywhere because the song popped into my head the other day and I can not remember the words for the life of me, If anyone can help me I would truly appreciate it, I know the beggining of the song starts like this.  I can't wait to see Jesus, in his glory as he burst through the sky, I can't wait to hear trumpets,   Thats as far as I can remember there is a line that says can't wait to get my sleeping bag unrolled, and the author is Pat Terry I believe, but I am stuck.  Please help this is driving me crazy!!!!  (Thats not a long drive but still I would prefer sanity) I have looked online everywhere I can think to look, including google and the like, looked on itunes ect.  
 because i want to download some dance songs and techno songs hot ones like that band raindrops stunt which Ministry Of Sounds cd is good  
 these are the lyrics of a song i heard the other day sung by a girl band.. anyone know by who?  
 i want the name of the song and artist  and if possible the year the lyrics go...  \"lovin me, lovin' me\" \"say that you love me!\"  \"fool me, fool me.\" \"say that youll fool me\"  
 Hey what are the rappers that r  with a girl friend or are married to a woman that have a kid from a diffrent daddy..  
 \"the models will have children, who'll get into Forbes, they'll find some role models, everything will run it's course\", when really it goes \"the models will have children, we'll get a divorce, we'll find some more models, everything will run it's course\"  did you?  I guess I was thinking more long term effects of living like that. But I'm not sure what getting into forbes would have to do with being a models kid.  
 im lookin for some r&b/hiphop songs that deal with candy or edible things. for example D4L's Laffy Taffy & lil waynes pineapple sunkiss ---lol i dont really like the actual song but pineapple sunkiss just sounded so delicious! if you have any songs dealin with food.. preferably sweet food. please tell me. thanks.  
 Like it's kind of a sad song where the boy asks \"is this enough to daddy to spend some time with me\" or something like that.  
 where it looks like there should be avatars, most people have really stupid-looking yahoo-created square smiling faces?  mq: favorite rolling stones song?

 What is that country song where it talks about a woman who is calling her ex-husband, or ex-boyfriend, i'm not sure which, and every time she calls he says he's out doing something on the message machine, but at the end he says: and if it's(girls name i can't remember) I still love you. Thanks you guys  
   
 in one of the commericials for lipstick jungle on australia's channel 7, there is music playing when two characters are making out.  the lyrics are \"you want it all, get on the floor\" i'm pretty sure those are the lyrics. please help me find it =)  
 The first lyrics are  \"All I need is your love babeh. All I need is your love babeh. All, all I need is your love babeh, your love babeh, your love babeh.\" Just like that, in a high pitched voice.  And the rest has a guy sorta rapping, and \"every single day\" keeps repeating.  The \"every single day\" part that repeats sounds just like in the song every single day by Dj jean, but it isnt that song, and I cant find the one I'm talking about anywhere!

 This morning on the radio I heard two cover tracks from an album of country music style covers of different songs, including \"Killing in the name\", originally by Rage against the Machine and \"On the Road Again\" originally by Willie Nelson. I didn't catch any of the the album or artist details unfortunately, but I would really like to know who performed these tracks (the album contains songs by several different artists) and what the album is called. Can anyone help? Thanks!

 I'm thinking of starting to rap but before I do you have to have the voice to rap and I just want some opinions from you to see if I have a voice that could start rapping..  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azk5SPJ7qiU  
 All I know about the song:  From the 1990s - kind of R&Bish - along the lines of \"Boy you should know that I've got you on my mind, secret admirer, I've been watching you...\"  The song is sung by a girl and guy but the girl has the larger part. They used to go out and she wishes that the guy she was with was him.   CONFUSED - if you've got anything let me know please.  
 Hallaw everyone! (: Ok, well is there any way that you can train your voice so you can hit lower notes? Like I can't hit the begining of Little Miss Obsessive by Ashlee Simpson very easily, or in 7 Thing by Miley Cyrus when she says \"You make me love you\" So yeah, is there any way I can expand my lower vocal range? Thanks to everyone<3

I listen to all types of music from Biggie, Korn, Jay Z, Wu Tang and Jimmie Hendrix Pink Floyd, and the Beatles. But now they are all old. And all this new **** is driving me crazy. I can download music for free but I cant think of any new bands, or hip hop artists that I would even want to down load.  They say that hip hop is dead and it trully is. Someone actually told me that Lil Wayne is better than Biggie. I almost slit his throat. And this damn Pussy rock that is out now is driving me crazy. Soldier boy is nothing but dance music. And I need good lyrics. But to get that I have to get underground Music. Please I need your opinion and if you have any good bands or hip hop artists let me know.  
 It goes something like \"You make me feel so ?in love?, you make me feel ?like?...\" IDK the rest. The words with question marks around them I think they're right but i could be wrong. It was this girls ringtone at school one year & I liked it & been searching for the song ever since but haven't gotten any luck. I've tried google, lyrics sites, youtube, & no its not you make me feel like dancing. It sounds like it could be Cascada, but I doubt it, or an artist with the same sound. NO, Chris Brown is R&B & plus I hate that song, & IDK, maybe it was a part of \"Heaven\" that I wasn't recognizing. Just checked out the \"heaven\" song, & no thats not it. Most likely the song came out in 2006 or before that.  
 its kinda old song for I THINK britney spears( a girl around 22 with blond hair) and she is like sad in the song and she had like a little white dog with her and like walking around in a european city maybe like paris...  
 It was a car commercial... by the way...  
 Wether It's been reported or a rumour :)  (Guns N' Roses)  
 lil wayne would not cry like this but the other one sounds just like tip and put me in tears laughing http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ji6qekcLxM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryQXqByVhRc&feature=related

 he is my pianist and he is really hard to work with. he also has some anger problems. i need him out because he is pulling apart our band. another problem is that the amazing lead guitarist is really good friends with him. he will probably be mad at me if i kick him out. What do i do? please help!  
   
 the lyrics go \"...p p p please let me tell you the reason why i keep all my secrets in my record collection...\"

 who sings the song at the very begining of drillbit taylor, chain hang low. but not jibbs. the song that the kids sing and then it goes to the two calling each other, its at the super dupper begining  
 in the new song viva la vida by coldplay, right before it goes \"roman calviery chiors are singing\" what does it say, something about bells?  
 I like listening to obscure bands that way people can't criticize me. I have an awful taste in music and when I say someone is my favorite band, most people can't insult me because they have no idea who they are.  what about you?  
 I really like Modest Mouse and The Dismemberment Plan. Any other indie bands that kind of sound like either of those two?  
 its kinda old song for I THINK britney spears( a girl around 24 with blond hair) where she had like a little white dog with her  and like walking around in a european city maybe like paris... she is around 22. and btw she look sad in the song  
 it is a young women singer and she is  like inside a heart with a red dress on and in the end she pulls papers off her wall  she is blond i think  it is like a new song that they show on VH1  dont know any lyrics  
 any artists preferably female on vocals on dark cabaret genre.  
 i need some really great Soca/ Reggae songs.  i love stuff like Red Wine (done by bob marley) and a song i recently heard called Hot Wuk.  thanks!!  
 In Lil Wayne's remix of Lollipop he says safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex because you don't want that late text that I think I'm late text What does text mean in I think I'm late text I know what everything else is. Thanks!  
   
 http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=28v4nwo&s=3  what lyrics are these  
 So it goes:  All I want to do Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo Wooo All I want to do Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo Wooo is love you   Why does that \"woo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, etc.\" part sound so familiar ?  I know that there is another song with that chorus (or at least something very similar), but I can't seem to remember what it is and it's really starting to bug me.  I've tried replacing the woo's and hoo's with doo's and doot's, as well as humming it, but it still eludes me.  Does anybody know the song I speak of ?  
 There was a Kinder Surprise Egg commercial on a while ago, and it had the beginning of a song playing in it. It was sang by a female.. it kind of started off like \"la da da,la da da\" :)  
 im a vocalist and used to be in a band. we played at parties but unfortunately my bass, guitarist and drummer all went for the navy. im looking for a guitarist who just want to play for fun and post vids on youtube... its good exposure! hit me up if you want to swap infos. my style is alternative... acoustic is the bomb! jason mraz... jack johnson... dashboard confessional... plain white ts... regina spektor... dido...

 i used to hear it a lot when i was a little kid, but never hear it anymore and i want to find it. i only remember little peices of it. it talked about when people see a guy(bum) asking for change they roll their window up or something. and when they hear a couple fighting they ignore it. this might be totally wrong lol i just cant remember what it was about all i know is that i liked it a lot!

 I was thinking of buying some flute scores for my friend\u2019s birthday.She has been taking classes for flute for about a few months and she had piano background for years. I have no idea what popular song are so I will be very appreciated if u all could recommend mi some nice flute pieces. Thanks in advanced :) Well, since I am not very familiar with instrumental music, I think I get something that is popular and mostly solo parts for the flute. I knew Canon will be a good choice but she knows how to play it with her piano scores by just adjusting something already.

 What's the lyrics for It Happens By Sugarland?  
 Guys & Gals....  I would really appreciate your professional views on this....  I have a tight budget and I just sold my beginner electric guitar (yamaha) to my frnd. So now, I'm guitar-less! I've been wanting to buy a professional electric guitar for almost a year now. So I went out and did some research and the only worthwhile pieces I came across were:  1. Dean Guitars (Dimebag, V, etc.) 2. ESP MH-400 3. Ibanez JEM (Steve Vai Sig. - not with the gold hardware and pearl inlays)  I play mostly hard rock / heavy metal genres. I loved the fact tht the ESP MH-400 had active EMG 81/85 pups (so I'm slightly biased to the ESP)  Please ppl, I wanna know what u think!

 Ok, whoever can figure out which song I'm talk about is awesome.  I have no idea what the song's name is, or which artist made it.  And to my knowledge the song contains very little lyrics, and the few words that are said in it I don't know because I always paid attention to the music.  So the only description I can manage to give of the song is pretty vague, so that's why anyone who can figure out which song I'm talking about has to be some sort of musical deity.  Ok, so here's what I can describe of the song:  I'm pretty sure one would classify it as a techno song.  The intro, and I'm pretty sure main part of the song, is something that sounds like several people (emulating a crowd I'm pretty sure) cheering (as if at some sports game) with something that sounds like the letter \"o\" with the tone of that sound going up and down with the beat of the song.   That's the best I can describe what I know of the song.  If anyone has any possible, outlsandish even, idea please respond!! Not Sandstorm (although it is a good song)  
 I like good techno. I have good techno. But i want more! =P  I like stuff like   Basshunter - Boten Anna && Dota  Alice DeeJay - Better off alone Comic gate - Exploration of space All Daft Punk songs.  Stuff with catchy beat rhythm. *Cosmic gate. I like most of their songs, but Exploration of space is best =]

 why hello. anyway....I need help and I got a few questions with trying to \"channel\", or so to speak, with my voice. I think I got a pretty good voice, but as usual I need to warm up. When I do, my voice has this certain quality that is incredible when found, but it happens once in a while. This makes my voice very melodic so I can go from singing softly to like screaming/shouting, and it sounds good!! How can I keep/use it when I want to???? This is going to bring that unique-ness to my future band but I need to know how i can channel this...and when does my voice fully develop????  
   
 I have no idea who is in the song and all i know is some lyrics. I heard it on power 106 the song goes like  \"when i grow up i wanna be a big balla like theres no tomorrow\" sumtin like that please anyone its so importan i need this song Lol pleae help The song im lookinh for is hipHop/rap  
 my friend loves both of the bands and i want to know what the big deal is about them. what is you favorite song by either or both  
 I MUST KNOW!!!!!!!!!  
 it goes \"and i know..\" and i don't know the rest of the lyrics. it was part of \"you outta know artist off the week\" like a week ago and it was a guy. he had an english accent and his hair was long and it showed his past pictures where his head was shaved. help? thanks so much :)  
 for you to call them one of your favorites?  I'm obsessed with that for some reason. I won't say I'm a fan of a band unless I have every CD by them. But other people will put every single band they know of on their 'favorite bands' list.  I realize this is an odd question.

 I have a Samick baby grand piano, and for some reason the sustain petal is stuck on.  It makes it really unpleasant for practicing.    So, is there any somewhat easy fix to this.  I would rather not have  a piano tuner come out until after the summer is over and the swamp cooler is turned off.    Any help would be appreciate. I looked at the rod and i lowered the limit stop so that the lever could go as far down as possible, but it still sticks.  It does not keep the full notes, they just linger more than they should, especially the lower notes.  I may call my piano tuner.

 Lets say that i want to change the note \"F\" in the key of c major to \"F#\" during the chorus of a song.

 I don't know much about Adele, but this song is beautiful.One of the best voices since Alison Moyet.! what do you think?......i can't stop listening to it.  
 The song is called \"Full Circle\" and I have no idea who it's by. I know that it's a jazz piece, and it's instruments only. I've scoured Limewire, iTunes, and somewhat of Google, but can't find the version I'm looking for. There's no words, and the tempo switches from 6/4 to 5/4, so I'd know instantly if that was the song.  Is anyone willing to take on this task? I know my description was broad, but I've never heard the recorded version that I'm looking for. We're playing this piece in my marching band, and my friend SWEARS she found it online. Thanks!  
 So far my friends have told me \"1 Day by Plies\" and \"Come back to me by Akon\"  Please only rap or r&b.

I mean how would you like it if someone just shot your dreams down from the start? I was seriously thinking of performing it somewhere. And I still want to. I will remember you all when I become famous. jk this isn't a real rap, i just mad it up to be stupid  
 WITHOUT having to convert it to wma first ect... (I have the song on CD and ripped it into my library but my converter won't open up the file) So, in other words, anyone know of a site that will let me add the song to my site??? It's not on her myspace page. Maybe it's my converter? I downloaded a free version of NB free. Can anyone suggest a different one??? What was meant to take minutes is taking hours! : (  
 I heard this song when i was in Hollister the other day. I only remember these words \" The weight of the world ... pushing down on ( its either \"you\" or \" your shoulders\" after that) PLEASSSEEEEEE HEEELP. it was kind of a rockish song if that helps. Thanks!   :]  
 then its like stop! there's nothing you can...or say? babbbbby.? please tell me!!  
 1)Do you feel like a man,when you push her around....   2)leave me here to be broken.... (sorry the 2nd one is kind of useless)    help me find these songs :] and by who

 Hi!  My alto sax reed it reasonably new, I don't know why but it is already growing mold in places which is quite disgusting.  Sometimes when I take the reed out it looks as if it's dirty, but when I look closer, it's just some little white bug things crawling around it.  It also smells digusting.  What's wrong with my reed? Do all reeds do that? Should I get a new one? - or will it just end up the same way?  
 u kno, the one that gets stuck in ur head and wen u google it there is no real result for it? that song

 like I am singing to each person induviually I know the key to that is heart or passion...I think I have that but this performance I'm doing is up beat and I want it to be entertaing or something you will definetly remember I don't have stage fright I just don't want to be another singer whoi just stands there? I have done lame performances that had no passion or no energy I just want to know what pumps up a crowd how can I connect to a bunch of 6 year old kids to teens without being over the top crazy,yet heartfelt? haha I deffinetly see where you are coming from see,even though 6 year olds have little minds,belive in cooties and have small crushes and pick boogers, I am still am looking for MORE! Why do 6 year olds enjoy the annoying Hannah Montanna and her lyp-syncing? is it because she puts in a good performance and mouthes words well is it because shes \"pritttey\" my guess is that she is entertaing obvoiusly, but when you perform in front of a large age range of people,whats best (to do)? I mean you deffinetly don't want your grandma hearing techno/electro or screamo!!! I am in a show in which it is being broadcast on tv (in our city) which means even if people watch you through a tv they can STILL connect with you no matter how old or young and say, wow that was just friggin sweet or funny or amazing  BASICAllY I want to find tips on ENTERTAING wide ranges fun things to,say during performances what makes you laugh,cry,and give  a performance you won't forget.  
 the band im in is performing at a local sports bar in about a week and we've decided on a final song line-up what are your opinions on it? (also only opinions no recomendations we really need to start practicing) (also if it matters i play guitar)  1. modest mouse - the view.  2. ACDC - thunderstruck.  3. guns n roses - godfather theme guitar solo.  4. lynard skynard - sweet home alabama.  5. aerosmith - dream on.  6 last song. guns N roses - civil war.  thats the final line up also the only reason were doing all non original songs is because we still haven't got the whole song making harmony down.

 This song is always on sirius left of center.  \"Love is gone, Love is lost\" or something along those lines. It's a great song, but have had no luck in finding it.  
 \"The World I Know\" by Collective Soul  Has our conscience shown? Has the sweet breeze blown? Has all the kindness gone? Hope still lingers on. I drink myself of newfound pity Sitting alone in New York City And I don't know why.  Are we listening? Hymns of offering. Have we eyes to see? Love is gathering. All the words that I've been reading Have now started the act of bleeding Into one.  So I walk up on high And I step to the edge To see my world below. And I laugh at myself While the tears roll down. 'Cause it's the world I know. It's the world I know.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rW6Px8WmN8  
 Put these 3 people from best to worse.  
 Ok. So, I'm having a difficult time understanding that the reason most people make a band is to look cool and impress people. I'm sick of it. All I want to do is write and play music and have it mean something! I mean, it doesn't matter if you're in a coffee shop with 3 people listening or a stadium....it's the message of music! Ugh. I'm just frustrated. I feel like I'll never find a dedicated group of people to work with. Where are the dedicated musicians? Thanks.....~Indie G   I really hope that doesn't sound snobby or whatever. I just can't find someone who'll stick with it...........

 What is your favorite Beatles glitch, individual instrument part, odd funny moment, underrated guitar, bass, or drums part, part that you think only you know about (something you can hear on a song but only if you listen REALLLL carefully)? Examples: John's cough of relief after finishing Twist and Shout; Ringo's awesome drumming in Rain; barking by Paul at end of I Feel Fine; Mal Evans' countdown and his alarm clock in A Day in the Life. Stuff like that, and yes you can use those examples IF they're your favorite. Only Criterion: Must be a regular issue recording, not live at Hollywood Bowl, Star Klub, Anthology or bootlegs (though I am partial to George's rendition of Mama You've Been on my Mind on Beatles Black Album), could be a \"lost\" 45/single version, mono or stereo. After it's done, I'll let you know what mine is. I said guitar, bass or drums... sorry, I mean ANY instrument or THING making a sound on an official Beatles recording. Thanks =)  
 Which Beatles song do you think is the most underrated and overrated and why? thanks :D  
 FREE

 I swear that I have heard this xylophone song before, and I believe it is has been used for a theme song for a television show. Other people have said that it sounds like the theme from American Beauty, but that's not it. It's driving me crazy!  
 i don't remember who sings it but it starts with a guy on the piano...there are two guys...saying something like when you go out to clubs at night i know that he don't be acting right but i can't stand to have you ever going away from me or some thing like that :/ please help  
 I'm really short.. about 5 foot 1. I'm going to see Paramore with my friend and I was wondering if i'm going to have a hard time seeing? You know since i'm so short. (:  
 I want to learn to play a musical instrument and I've been looking into buying a drum kit. But, I don't have a lot of money (I am going to get a job, but even then...) and I don't want to buy an awful set. So I was wondering what good brands sell cheaply, hopefully around $500 at the most. If that isn't going to happen please tell me, thanks. I want to learn to play a musical instrument and I've been looking into buying a drum kit. But, I don't have a lot of money (I am going to get a job, but even then...) and I don't want to buy an awful set. So I was wondering what good brands sell cheaply, hopefully around $400 at the most. If that isn't going to happen please tell me, thanks. Amazon and eBay give me cheap drum sets, not a guide to how good they are And, that top edit, that was an accident. I was trying to lower the price ranger but, well, this is a horrible program  
 The beginning is like, \"Does it mean much, Doesn it mean anything.\"  I can't remember the rest, but it's a rock songg.

 I went to see Chris Rock perform last month.  Before he came out, there was music playing.  This one song got stuck in my head, it was mid-tempo and one of those neo-soul songs.  I don't know the artist or the name of the song, I  was told that the song gets played on the BET Jazz channel.  The only lyrics I could make out were \" This World\"...  I don't think its by Ledisi, I've been looking up neo-soul artists on amazon and I haven't found anything.  
 Tupac Biggie  Nas Jay Z  These are the G.O.A.T's people claim so who would shine if they did a song together and please dont say all of them  
 I need help get the song \"heartbeat\"by Stereo Skyline..but i cant find an mp3 version..can you please help me with this and can u please send me the link to where to find it too!   thankz\u2665  =)

 I am just looking for some new music.  
 Because if it is, then im really uncomfortable by it. My Chemical Romance always managed to be a great band WITHOUT a pianist. I  mean, you cant even hear the keyboard anyways, except for in songs like the Black Parade and You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison. I mean seriously, whats up with that? I'll slowly get used to it, but still. He was better in Reggie and the Full Effect. Supposedly, he declared himself a part of the band, but i really dont want him in. I mean, hes great and all, but not in MCR. He seems good and all, i dont know why im uncomfortable with it. But its just hard to get used to six people instead of 5. Does this sound right? Mikey, Ray, Bob, Gerard, Frank, James? It doesnt sound to fitting Its true though. Its all about the music, so i guess i can get over that. It willt ake me a while to get used to him though.. *sigh* Now that i think of it, i dont really care about him. I can pretend hes not there or something. As long as he doesnt show up on posters, or on pictures in the album or something  
 Artist: Stress Album:Unequal Balance Song: Left Behind  Link: http://www.zshare.net/audio/1415039541223518/ All opinions welcome. By the way, its not me spittin on the track. I'm just wondering what people thought of it.

 Me and my dad might go and I was just wondering about the stages? There is a Jagermeister stage, Hot Topic Stage and Main stage. how does that work? do they share the same stage but change it to the different sponsors as different bands come on? Or are there 3 different stages? I am just really confused. And is section 205 row VV good seats?  
 What songs should I listen to by them? Thanks!  
 Doesn anyone know any bands similar to Nightwish??  If you don't know who Nightwish is, it will be hard to answer, but basically its a metal band with an orchestral background. Some like to call it symphonic metal. Also the lead singer is a female. (I'm not to picky about the lead singers, I'm just looking for other symphonic metal bands).  The ones I already know of are: Within Temptation Kamelot Epica Sonata Arctica Dimmu Borgir  Looking for some different ones though. Any suggestions??  
 I heard this song by LL Cool J, and it had like wierd keyboard sounds in it, like electronic. the sounds are similar to those in blueberry yum yum. which song is this??  
 I can't find them anywhere. I heard the song when I was at girl scout camp when I was younger, and can't seem to remember the song anymore. I'm trying to teach it to my Day Care class, but need to remember the rest of the song. It's driving me crazy! Thanks alot!! nope... that's a pop song... this is a sing along song for children... please read everything next time.  
 1. Tupac (Too me, he was the realest rapper, he had a unique ability that nowhen else had..he could make you feel the pain of someone from the ghetto when you're rich, or from the suburbs. 2. Big Pun (I just loved his vicious style and lyrical ability) 3. Big L (I loved his punchlines, lyrics were sometimes funny and fit together really well 4. Notorious B.I.G (Was a lyrical beast, and story teller. Had mad flow) 5.Nas (Mostly because of his 'ether' track, one of the best diss tracks i've heard) 6. Eazy-E (Hard to explain, it's just something about him I really like 7.DMX (I liked him because his songs really pump me up [ruff ryders anthem, also my first rap song ever heard, and one of my favourites] 8. Eminem  (I like his vicious, and violent style. Also a very  good writer) 9.Lil' Wayne (Debatable, I know, I just like his creative lyrics, which some people aren't quick enough to understand) 10. TIE: Fabolous/Lloyd Banks (I know, this pick is very contriversial. I just like their flow, and punch lines.)   WHO IS YOUR TOP 10?  
 Ok, so I heard this song on some hold music. It was extremely staticy but I tried to get as much as I could before they picked up.  It's a sad country song, with a catchy melody.   I'd swear part of the song said this (or something similar)  something something (maybe you are) \"All I see\". And then went into \"your happiness is raining all over (or down) on me\"   And I'd also swear that after that he said \"purple rain is gone\" - However, it could be something that rhymed with purple. But pretty sure \"rain is gone\" is part of it as well.   It's not Tim McGraw - She's my kinda rain, or Songs About Rain.   Thanks That video not only has nothing to do with my question, but it's extremely retarded anyways...  Is she on crack?  
 I want a popular song that most people know, and a song that will make even the worst singers sound amazing. The song needs to be easy to dance to, so it isn't boring for the audience.

 What songs do you recommend I listen to by them? Thanks!  
 I was HIGHLY impressed by how quickly and accurately my last (vague) song question got answered, so I'm trying an even harder one.  I heard a song on a Boston rock or alternative radio station today (song is probably from the last 5-8 years), some time between 7-8pm.  It's an all--male band, fast, and some of the lyrics might include words about being on the edge of the bed, a nightmare, something about a head.  Whelp, that's about it.  Help if you can! By the way.....this was a really popular song at some point (again, last 5-8 years max).  Anyone in their 20's would recognize it instantly, if that helps.  
   
 im wanted 2 study guitar...but... im so confused which guitar shall i've ? regular acoustic or classical guitar ? n..cud u plz tell me what brand should i buy..yamaha ? cort ? gibson ? + da site 2.  tnx---xoxo  
   
   
 i need ideas for an acapella group name. we are 4 girls, and we don't have any names yet. we sing acapella. before we sing just for fun, and now we got invitation to school function, opening nights, and parties. we don't have names, so people just call us 'the acapella group'. I think it ugly and we need ideas....help? oh and the reason i'm asking names  from people over the internet is because i want some IDEAS. So that i can bring those names to the discussion of my group. but thank you very much dumbmasterbeanz for calling me stupid.

 Ok, so I was watching adult swim, and I saw Gerard Way say that it was their last show of the Black Parade ever... and it said all this crap about how they were selling the live cd and stuff... but.... idk.. I'm confused and scared..  
 just asking  
 pretty much the whole song reminds me a lot of the very beginning of \"stronger\"-kanye west almost has a techno feel lyrics kind of sound like \"move it, fix it, rock it\" over and over with different start words. i know it would help if i knew the artist or lyrics but i dont.  the song was popular within the past few months, but it isnt on the charts anymore.  PLEASE HELP ASAP! thanks =]  
 So I'm going to try listening to them...what songs do you recommend you listen to? Thanks!

 HELLO! I was wondering if you guys knew of any bands I may like. My favorite genres are metal, hard rock and punk. Here's a list of bands: -Green Day -Evanescence -Avenged Sevenfold -Black Tide -The Confession -Lacuna Coil -Within Temptation -Nightwish -Epica -Breaking Benjamin  I really like the female-fronted metal bands (you could probably tell that) but if you could tell me some of them or just other bands like the ones I mentioned, that'd be great! THANK YOU SO MUCH! :) Oh, I like Jack Johnson and James Blunt, too! Their a little random but I love them! PS- I hate Paramore.  
 The Bangles were certainly one of the hottest girl groups of the 1980's and early 90's. They split up for a while but were reunited in the early 21st century with a new album. Their bright, happy music was a great fusion of rock 'n' roll, British rock, soft rock, pop, and country. They sang all the songs in exquisite four-part female harmonies and played their own instruments as a very prolific self-contained band. All too soon, it was over.   Susanna Hoffs was lead singer and rhythm guitarist. Vicki Peterson was the electric guitarist and her sister Debbi Peterson played the drums. Michael Steele rounded out the band on bass guitar.  Flashy, elegant, and beautiful, these girls were the Bangles. Who is your favorite member of the Bangles? And why do you choose her from the other three? Any stories of meeting the girls or attending their concerts are welcome!  
 Why do guitarist use power amps live with their heads when sound engineers mic their cabs and keep the volume down anyway?

 I remember that the video was from late 90's or early 2000's and there was a room with a large glass window and girls or people were dragged there and made to dance all together... and they were all matching and it was in a i think green themed room   thanks heaps!  
 I got mine from a good music store about 2 months ago.  And when I try to use it...nothing happens.  I've read that there is supposed to be a fine dust on the strings and that you need to wipe that strings just a bit after putting it on.    But I can't get anything to go on my strings, and it looks like it has never been touched. Both the strings and the rosin.   I got the type that is a bar and has wood on 3 sides so you can hang onto it.     It is a lovely color of deep honey and see through.  It would make beautiful jewelry....but I would rather make music.      Do I have to heat it up or something? Sure could use some good answers....    thanks  
 This is probably no where close but i'll give it a shot anyways \"if im your man....\" I know Akon sings the verse so im guessing its his song. you guys have any clue? thanks.

I'm twenty-one now, and I'm looking to get in touch with them, so could anyone who has an email address of theirs (as I'm in the states, they're in Australia, and I don't have long distance) provide it to me? I'd be very greatful.   Thanks in advance to those who answer.  
 I started playing the harmonica when I was eleven, two  years ago. I can't seem to find any good tabs on the internet. I've tried harptabs.com, but sometimes the tabs aren't quite right there. The songs on Jack's Harmonica Page are a little too easy. Where can I find some free harmonica tabs for an intermediate or advanced player?

 The song is sang by a man and the music video is set in a swamp.  It was from the past two years, I believe it is more on the sad side but I'm not positive.  I'm sorry I can't think of more details, but it is driving me crazy trying to think of what it is!

 From 1980 to their retirement in 2005 Alabama was the premier country music band in America. They had 42 number one hits and sold some 70 million records. They opened the door for other bands to form and be successful in country music. Alabama had staying power. They were always \"the people's band.\"  The four members of Alabama stayed together for over 25 years, never once changing personnel. Led by lead singer and rhythm guitarist Randy Owen, the band was made up of Randy's cousins Jeff Cook on electric guitar and fiddle, and Teddy Gentry on bass guitar. Owen, Cook, and Gentry provided exquisite down home harmonies. The band was rounded out by colorful drummer Mark Herndon.  Who is your favorite member of Alabama? Tell us why you like him the most. If you have any stories of meeting the band, please share!  
   
 I\u2019ve learned to let go Come on  Here\u2019s a middle finger Coming straight from oca-l-a I appreciate your judgement it\u2019s proved that I can\u2019t trust a word you say those must be some pair of binoculars that you see every move I make so I\u2019ll never be a liar but you\u2019ll always be two-faced  
 This is such a vague memory....sorry I don't have more specifics.  I'm trying to find the name of a song or the band who did it.  I can somewhat recall the video (I think it's from the past five years or so).  It's a male band but there was a woman (playing piano?) and singing the same refrain over and over -- something about coming home?  The video just shows the band members and the woman sitting, kind of vacantly, in various parts of a house.  It also has stills of different families affected by war.  Thanks!  
 It is a pop song and it sounds kinda like 80's European pop.  It has like a shooting sound in it made by like a drum machime or something. It sounds like 80's European pop like \"luft balloons\" or something.  It could possibly be hip hop.  Not sure.  The gun sounds are like \"pow pow pow pow\" (even though Im not sure thats what its supposed to sound like).  Its kinda slow.  
 it sounds like the singer from coldplay but it isnt i dont remeber any lyrics but its a high tone guy singing???? it isnt coldplay tho its a singer whos voice sounds like the lead singer form coldplay? its also pretty old  
 what note should be played here?it;s from Chopin nocturne in E flat major http://p13.facemm.net/p.aspx?u=v20_p13_p_0807021131241762_0.jpg&click=1

 I love this song from the movie Forrest Gump, but I don't think it is in the movie at all and it's not on either of the two soundtracks. You can watch/listen here. The most prominent and clearest part of the song occurs around 3:00. http://youtube.com/watch?v=JdsMqRaz2WY  
 Here's the link to see the nominees accompanied with the song:  http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?id=1588375&vid=237148  
 It's upbeat and sung by a female.  In the middle of the song girls yell \"hit 1, hit 2, hit 3, hit 4\" and ends with \"see ya later\".  I know its kinda vague but any suggestion helps.    Thanks.

 I want to be a rapper, but I would prefer doing innocent type rap music for Disney. I love the way the Disney channel and the Disney channel stars are so happy, and the people that do music for Disney like the Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus, and other people  are just people who love their craft and are doing what they love. That is what I want to do. Do you think Disney would accept a good hearted rapper that does the same thing? I think teens would love a rap star for Disney. What do yall think?

 I recently visited Cancun, Mexico (very nice trip, btw) and when I hung out by the pool they would play music and I really liked these two (I think Mexican) songs. I know some lyrics but not enough and I can't figure them out... I want to so bad though because they're catchy and I just really liked them. :) Anyone think they might know them?  Lyrics that I know: 1st - \"Si, Si, Si, no, no, no\" 2nd - \"To the left, left, left\" & \"To the right, right, right\" & \"Shake it, shake it, shake it.\"  The main problem is that the lyrics that I remembered don't really help because so many songs have those lyrics in them. & I already tried my best to search them up on the net.  Please help. :/

 Hey,    I own the Video Game The Hobbit, and I loved the music that came with it. I got the Video Game Soundtrack and I play Guitar, so I was wondering if anyone knows the guitar chords to the music on the soundtrack.

 Ever Ever After by Carrie Underwood single? Other than limewire, itunes, or,  rhapsody

 I heard this song a few nights ago on our local alternative station. I caught the end of it and the guy singing had a higher sort of voice, not grizzly at all. Sort of like Evans Blue but I'm pretty sure it wasn't them. I didn't catch many lyrics because it was the end of the song but I know I caught the word \"sweet\" several times. Anyone have any ideas? Yeah....no. Think of the guy from Tool or Evans Blue.  Thats the way his voice was. and the word sweet wasnt attached to any other words.  
 im a upcoming dj  but i want to help one of my friends out with rapping so i wanted to know what's a good microphone that's cheap in price but that has a good quality  
 Ferde Grofe(1892-1972), is not a very well-known American composer.      If you are familiar with him and his works/life, care to share your knowledge about, and assessment of his contributions with us?      If not familiar, is there any particular question you would like to ask of others about him?

 Give either the title or a line in a song with a girl's name.  
   
 He saw a lonely girl. She saw a lonely world. It was a canvas, slyly careless. A florestan lieder.  And his was a dying breed. Courage came only from his symphonies. A decorative smile to fade out. His concerto in A  Come on. A second chance at love. The moments dead. Make you feel like it's never staying.  Made love to a baby grand. A tempest refined inside his hands. He had one girl, and one song. Bone fide wine and roulade.  But he had to give it up. His heart was raw. But his fingers numb. His first words were his last words. An aesthete since first sun.  Come on. A second chance at love. The moments slept. Make you feel like it's never staying.  It burned. The first attempt or two. But I remembered you. I need that moment back.  Please don't, don't don't. A tremor for death. Ivories that sliced sedatives in half. Releif in the Rhine. Washed away regrets. And let him char before he carressed the ground.  Dear artist you will rise again. A last arabesque in faint fashion.  Come on.  
 I wish I had more to offer, but this is all I have: * The band (or singer) sounds like Blues Traveler, or someone similar; *The only line I can recall is from the chorus and is along the lines of \"Don't you know the road that you're on....(there's more to that line, I just can't remember it) *The song is a little up-tempo.  Any help would be appreciated. It's been driving me nuts for a week now, and I've gotten nowhere doing lyrics searches. It's definitely NOT an Eagles song

 (Country music reminds me of cattle with fast metabolisms, for some reason. Oh, but no, I'm NOT calling YOU that either way, just because I said this!)  :)   Hey, come back later to see my responses to yours, okay? (Oh, by the way, guys, I don't just mean only if listening to that music while pooping, but listening to that generally more often.) John W., thanks for your answer, but I think you misunderstood the question. You didn't read it very well. I didn't ask women how good or big their poopers are. I asked them how much better poopers THEY ARE if they usually listen to country music, than if they listen to other music.   Hey, \"Bad Company,\" thanks for sharing your example, even though it's not related to country music. That's okay, still, because I still enjoyed hearing about it!  :)  Oh, and I also enjoyed your favorite choice of beef cut to be. Heheh, that's amusing!  Thanks! P.S. Yeah, truthfully, I'm not a big country music fan (although I did still happen to somewhat enjoy the country music concert held at Utah Valley State College as it would become Utah Valley University a day later--where they had Josh Gracin, Collin Raye, and Joe Nichols). But I'm still plenty regular!  :)

 i heard this song on americas got talent and i wanna download it. i only heard a few phrases 123 ... so fine, gonna make you mine..  
 It was a song probably in the early to `mid 90s...Its not Salt N Pepa, Garbage, Corbin Bleu, Kids with Guns, Jump In, or Rick Ross. It was a catchy beat- just a guy singing very low for a few lines and the girls are in the background louder saying \"push it push it\". It's more R&B / rap related--so no rock answers please. PLEASE HELP ME OUT :-)!!  
 Hello, I'm looking for albums  of pop or rock hits  but in jazz or swing versions. I already have 1 album from a band called \"Berk and The Virtual Band\" which has songs like YMCA or  Billy Jean in Jazz versions, so which other albums can you sujest me ?  
 It was a song probably in the early to `mid 90s...Its not Salt N Pepa, Garbage, Corbin Bleu, Kids with Guns, Jump In, or Rick Ross. It was a catchy beat- just a guy singing very low for a few lines and the girls are in the background louder saying \"push it push it\". It's more R&B / rap related--so no rock answers please. PLEASE HELP ME OUT :-)!!  
 Who sings this song \"hit me on my myspace, come over to my place, wanna see ya pretty face, girl want you give me a taste of you, girl want you give me a taste of you. x2.  A man sings it! But I can not figure out who sings it! Plzzzz Help me.  
 They were all young, and the music video showed them at a bar having fun. At one point all of them are sitting on the bar and the youngest falls off. I know its not rascal flatts like everyone keeps telling. Any help would be greatly appreciated...its been bugging me for almost a yr now.

 Anyone else think that video is kinda creepy?  And, who else is in this song? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgjA5NLFjKM R.I.P CaPut account  hahaha  
 yeah busta rhyme has been in the game for a while but for whoever said he could even hang with lil wayne in a free style battel must be on drugs. lil wayne has way more experience coming from off the dome. if buster even atempted to even try to battle wayne in a battle no only would he lose but he would look really foolish. i admit busta can rap but he needs a pad and a pen as with lil wayne his pad and pen is coming off the dome . the reason he is considered the all time best rapper lil wayne doesnt need mix tapes to come off the dome. i said busta use to be hot in the rap game but he has not originality when you are comparing him to a legend like lil wayne . lil wayne is just to experienced at punch lines without a pad coming off the dome and i dont just mean mix tapes .doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out why he is so hot and he is being considered the greatest rapper of all time . im sorry but busta hasnt proven anything . he can rap but you would have to be on drugs to even think busta can even be in the same category as wayne as legends let alone even put his name next to his . are you kidding me he cant be calling himself the best ? weezy is a lyrical genius that makes a living off of making albums from off his dome while other people write it down for him . if your going to call the ghost writing i guess that a compliment . meaning he doesnt need a pen and a pad and the words just flow on the paper so that ghost? you basically complimented weezy and dont even know it . you never hear about people saying busta would even come close to weezy let alone busta even saying it himself . all you hear is lil wayne is the best until you come on here then you have haters who deny what a true mc is . busta hasnt proven nothing in his career and you will never hear his name when it comes to the best rappers let alone a true freestyler like weezy . william thanks for the verse you always have haters. when jayz was running things there was haters,when pac ,and biggie was around it was haters now its weezy i never said that lil wayne never writes his rhymes at all . but as far as freestyling and coming from off the dome he does it about 90% of the time . even kanye said when he worked with him in the studio he is impressed and believe hes the best . i complimented busta and said he can rap but we are talking about rappers who are consideredthe greatest . and im the only person who ever said he was the greatest are you kidding me ? you have rappers like kanye complimenting him you have article about him being the best . but why are we jumping off to other rappers and about comments how im the only person who said hes the best ? this topic was basically toward a previous poster who said that busta rhymes could hang with wayne . yeah you hear busta was a good rapper but he never made the impact a weezy,busta,jayz,pac,or biggie did on hiphop plus hes very creative with his rhymes . i give busta his props as a good rappers but hes not made of a legend like weezy or the other rappe i named  
 ?????  
 I know some artists that have great songs of this genre, but I need to know what songs to download specifically. I am making a mix for my friend. She is a very upbeat person, so she loves this kind of upbeat music. Like the kind you hear at clubs. No hip hop, no happy hardcore or crazy techno, just the good house and electronica music (even maybe some good trance would be nice!!)  If someone reccomends me a bunch of songs, (specifically songs, not just the artist) I will ever be so grateful, and the 10 points will go to you!!!  
   
 kathy perry or yea yea yeahs  
 Thanks for your help!!! =]

 What are some sad songs? I mean like you know songs that really get you in the mood. I'm a teen going traveling tommorow. So I have to sit in a car for 13 hours and I love sad songs. I don't mean sad like pain sad, but I just LOVE the soft beat of those songs.  For instance:  Home - Chris Daughtry Bad Day - Daniel Powter  And what about hiphop/upbeat songs, but not like those songs that get you hiped up! Songs like:  Good Day - Nappy Roots  I'm more of a sad song type girl, but once in awhile I like to have a little faster beat (ONCE and awhile). Thanks!

 My friend of mine, who yes is a guy, sent me this song and it was Lifehouse's 'From Where You Are'. Now, I want to send a song back too, but don't know what one, and I'd like a song that doesn't have anything dealing with like love. Or is it does, it's little with no hint of 'wanting a relationship'.  Any ideas?

 HEY IM LOOKING FOR THE SONG THAT GOES ' ROUND AND ROUND YOU GO' I HEARD IT ON THE SHOW JACKASS PLEASE  HELP!  
 I was calling to verify my order for a camera, and the hold music was playing a country song I really liked.   The stupid cell phone signal was low, so I couldn't get the lyrics clear enough.  All I remember is this:  \"....all I see.\" ------\"your happiness -static sound- raining on meeee\"  Now, I THINK he said \"purple rain is gone\"  Sorry for being so vague.  Thanks Sorry, not it. It's more of a sad song, with a really catchy chorus Nope, not She's My Kinda Rain. Sounds close though. Only missing is the \"happiness\" included in the lyrics.   Nice try though.  
 There are three versions at Best Buy.  1) 2-Disc CD.  The first CD has 13 songs.  The Bonus CD has 5 songs that were leaked. 2) Single disc version. 16 songs 3) Single disc version 13 songs  Also, what are the 3 Bonus tracks inside the case?  Are any of the \"leaked\" songs on the radio?  Whick version should I get?  
 first off, Its not \"I believe I can fly\" by r kelly  but something similar.  a rock song, by a male artist, kinda famous(idk who)  heard it on da radio  goes something like: \"aint no .........(dont know the words)......... up hiiiiiiiiiigh...into the skyyyyyy......i believe\"  please give me ANY song that came to your head. AND I MEAN ANY SONG THAT U CAN THINK OF!!!  
   
 it goes ............ ahh ah ah ahhhh wanna go into my bed something like that and the bass sounds like it rattling some metel well it a male its a male  its a today song like on rap stations and stuff and it goes shawty so good  
 ive googled it with no luck, its and alt rock band btw  
 There is a fast classical song that sounds like the beginning music of bittersweet symphony. It has been played in cartoons I believe. Does anyone know this piece?  
 so, music help, please? :) I want some songs that pumps  you up, like music you listen to  when you exercise. No rap or  R & B or metal, unless you think that it's so good that I have to  listen to it. thank you! :D I already know happy hardcore,  & they're good :) no top 40's, please! of course, unless it's really good :)  
 I know there are various ways, but which is the most inexpensive. The room I would be soundproofing is on the second floor, overlooking the street. It isn't too large, but enough for a simple drum kit, room for bass player, room for guitarist, and a bed. I'd be willing to spend 100-200 dollars, but my budget doesn't fit in anything more expensive. What is the best way to a) block sound from leaving the room b) reduce outside noise and c) lower overall noise volume within the room itself. Thanks!  
 whats the song that goes you are the one the one that lies close to me whisperes so.......... somthin somthin or other  
 This song is several years old.  I don't know the name of it, but I think 50 Cent is in it.  Does anyone know the name of it?  
 It's just called \"Volar\". Not \"Ven A Volar\" or \"A Volar\". And I'm talking about the new Menudo with Chris Moy, Monti Montanez, Carlos Olivero, Emmanuel Pagan, and Jose B. Collazo. I meant to download it too, not just find it and listen to it online.  
 for about a month now i've been trying to find out when girlicious's cd came out so like if anyone knows could you plz let me know?  
 You can scream and say \"I hate you\" You can slam the door I walk through It doesn't matter, woah No, 'cause we are in love  It goes something like that.. I saw it on the premiere of the \"Secret Life of the American Teenager\" during the school dance. It was kind of techno and it had a fast beat.   Someone help please?  
 i heard this song from a music profile its called im sorry but i wanna know who sings it. i love this song i wanna get it on my ipod but i cant find it in limewire.so can someone please tell me who sings the songs. heres the link to the profile its the last one that says im sorry thankz. http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=210982783

 The only time in history when rock and rap were enjoyed by blacks and whites in large numbers is during the Monterary Pop Festival Era. In other words kids, the 1960s. Back then, you had blacks and whites that both enjoyed many different genres of music. But at the same time. Both races very much misunderstood each other.  I think this is a prime example of history repeating itself, but not as violent and ignorant as it was back then. But now during the internet age, cultural differences are more exposed and have helped to desegregate music more than ever before. The only problem is that most new artists don't have a clue of what they are dong, and that goes for both rap and rock.  In other words, some (not all) people that criticize rap or rock are going back into the ignorant naive way of thinking about music genres in general. These types of people do not move ahead, but focus on the stereotypes of those genres, and the things that they only play on the radio.  Agreed?  
 a male R&B artist from the 90s that had a one hit with the lyrics, the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you say my name, your smile, the way you move me, the way you grove, when I look in your eyes, I realize, I just want to be with you

 ok this will probably be a dumb question, and i know the answer i am looking for is right in front of my eyes im just not seeing it. I kno that scale are what all riffs, chords, and songs are made of , but i just cant see how people are getting these riffs out of a scale. I guess the right question would be \"How do I create a riff from a scale? \"  
 i work in the mall at a clothing store called express. I keep hearing this song that i love but i cant find it. In the chorus it goes  \" If i had to love you\" i just cant remember the rest! it sounds kinda reggaeish!

 it's an indie song, by a band with a guy singer, it starts out with the guitar in the start of the song, then yea. he kinda sings softly so i couldn't quite understand him, but from what i GUESS he's saying, all i remember is, \"don't forget this summer. this summer never ends.\" or something. then towards the end it's something like, \"and i miss you, but not in the sad way, but i miss you.\" it's pretty much the same guitar riffs through out the song, thanks<3 i'll add more if i remember any. but i probably won't =l oh, & i heard it on the radio station indie 103.1 :) grrrr no one? :( i thought it was incubus cause of the beginning of the song, but no.

 It was played a bit on Triple J not long ago but I never caught the name of the song or artist. It goes something like \"we got soul, maybe not as much as the late james brown, but enough to shake up the town\".  
 I think that Pat Benatar has to be in the top ten female rock singers.  
 part of the song says \"i think about you when the sun is high\" i think, or when the sun is hot. i dont really know. lol. and another part says \"of all the good times we've had baby\" i heard it on the radio today and i cannot find it.

 I've been playing my guitar through a 4-track (as a pre-amp), and then plugging the line out into my laptops mic input (its a pc, if that makes any difference). Unsurprisingly, I get a bad hissing noise when i try to record this. Is there any simple way I can get rid of the hissing, or should I just suck it up and buy a usb/firewire adapter ?

 In the XM ad campaign \"Falling Stars\", there was an XM ad featuring Snoop Dogg falling into an office building. When he stood up and looked through the hole in the roof, what was the name of his song that was playing? And NO, it is not Vato. (that is the one with the cartoon) This was one of the original ads when XM first came out.

 hey i need some good workout music i like hip/hop and rap anything fast paced is good! please no more than 10 answers on each list thanks  
 Alright, i consider myself a true music fan; a fan of nearly all music genres. I grew up on rap and rock, and a person who grew up on both of these and listens to both knows how to find artists that best reflect the true talent in the genres.  So labeling one as Talentless makes one Tasteless, if you know what i mean.  My favorite rock bands include Earth and Fire, The United States of America, Darkside Mirrors, early Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Jefferson Airplane, Moody Blues, L7, Hendrix, BB King, Syd Barret(my himself), Joe Byrd and the Field Hippies, H.P Lovecraft, Broadcast, The Electric Prunes, and many, many more.  Favorite rap artist, include Pastor Troy, Pac, Talib Kweli, Lauren Hill, MC Lyte, Sha Rock, T Rock, KRS One, Nas, Three Six Mafia (their old underground stuff before they were famous), and many many more.  So, as you can see, if you actually seek and find the music, you will know that there is actually good to rap. and good to rock, if you truly are a fan of music. I truly believe that more people that come on here and quote the fad line \"I think rap is crap\" have never even took the time out to seek and find things that aren't played on the radio, and things that weren't made in the past 5 years. Most of these types of people have bad taste in rock as well.
