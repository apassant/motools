# Three entities to consider
#   1) Cultural identifier (e.g. "Sgt. Pepper")
#     - Issued from a recording session lasting 129 days, starting on the 6th of December 1966
#   2) Tracklist
#     - A set of tracks: Track 1 is ... Track 2 is ... 
#     - One cultural identifier may have many tracklists
#   3) Release (e.g. UK on the 1st of June 1967, US on the 2nd of June 1967)
#     - One tracklist may have many releases

# Relationships to existing MO concepts
#    1) 
#       mo:Signal has been used for it so far, but this is confusing (we want something higher-level)
#       We want to keep a track of a recording session event, which product is this cultural identifier
#    2)
#       Corresponds to our current mo:Record
#    3)
#       Not handled yet. We can model that as another event.
#       We need to reconsider the status of mo:release_type and mo:release_status when adding it

# Existing level 1 MO stuff
mo:Track a owl:Class .
mo:Record a owl:Class . 
mo:Signal a owl:Class .
mo:track a owl:ObjectProperty; rdfs:domain mo:Record; rdfs:range mo:Track .

# Cultural identifier 
# Based on Zazi's email, http://groups.google.com/group/music-ontology-specification-group/browse_thread/thread/8e1ec6cc68e2c035
mo:RecordingSession a owl:Class; rdfs:subPropertyOf event:Event .
# an mo:RecordingSession can be decomposed in several performances/recordings using event:sub_event to be described in further details
mo:Album a owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf mo:MusicalExpression . # Matches Musicbrainz terminology, but not sure if it is an appropriate name
mo:produced_album a owl:ObjectProperty rdfs:domain mo:RecordingSession; rdfs:range mo:Album .

# Tracklist
mo:Tracklist a owl:Class; owl:equivalentClass mo:Record . # Do we need that? Or can we keep on using mo:Record?
# Adding Zazi's trackcount property
mo:track_count a owl:DatatypeProperty; rdfs:range mo:Record .

# Release events
mo:ReleaseEvent a owl:Class; rdfs:subClassOf event:Event .
mo:label a owl:ObjectProperty; rdfs:domain mo:ReleaseEvent; rdfs:subPropertyOf event:agent .
