Version 1.11 (March 2007)
=========================

 * ADDED: Performance and Show
 * ADDED: records (inverse of recordedAs) and publicationOf (inverse of
 publishedAs)
 * ADDED: mo:composer (Composition --> Agent)
 * ADDED: mo:producesWork (Composition --> MusicalWork)
 * ADDED: mo:usedInPerformance (Work --> Performance)
 * ADDED: mo:productOfComposition (MusicalWork --> Composition)
 * ADDED: mo:usesWork (Performance --> MusicalWork)
 * ADDED: Medium subclassof MusicalItem
 * ADDED: mo:producesSound (Perfomance --> Sound)
 * ADDED: mo:usedInRecording (Sound --> Recording)
 * ADDED: mo:usesSound (Recording --> Soung)
 * ADDED: mo:producesSignal (Recording --> Signal)
 * ADDED: shortcut mo:recordedAs (Performance --> Signal)
 * ADDED: term status: all subproperties of hasAgent, hasProduct, has Factor
 are stable, all the inverse are unstable
 * ADDED: mo:musibrainz
 (Work;Expression;Manifestation;Item;Agent;Instrument;Genre --> Document)
 * ADDED: mo:ep a ReleaseType
 * ADDED: mo:publicationLocation (MusicalManifestation --> SpatialThing)
 * ADDED: mo:contains_sample_from (Signal --> Signal)
 * ADDED: wrapper for event:place (Event --> SpatialThing)
 * CHANGED: pitch and timber' domain: now Signal
 * CHANGED: remixed has as a domain Signal, same for the range of remixer
 * CHANGED: same thing for sampled/sampler
 * CHANGED: same thing for djmixed
 * CHANGED: same thing for remix_of
 * CHANGED: same thing for medley_of
 * CHANGED: same thing for djmix_of
 * CHANGED: same thing for remaster_of
 * CHANGED: same thing for mashup_of
 * CHANGED: collaborated_with/other_release_of are symmetric
 * CHANGED: added inverse properties statements on all djmix/...
 * CHANGED: mark compilation_of as unstable. this should be done through a
 release type and through explicit links to each Signal.
 * CHANGED: translation_of goes from a MusicalExpression to a
 MusicalExpression (well, a Work is independent of its wording)
 * CHANGED: tribute_to from MusicalManifestation to Artist



 NOTE: 
 * remix_of/djmix_of should be transitive?
 * other_release_of is *really* vague...
 * compilation_of and tribute_to should be removed... too redundant with
 existing stuff, and not even shortcuts
 * musicbrainz is maybe too ambitious in its domain
