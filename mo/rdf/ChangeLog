 * ADDED: mo:ep a ReleaseType
 * ADDED: mo:publicationLocation (MusicalManifestation --> SpatialThing)
 * ADDED: mo:contains_sample_from (Signal --> Signal)

 * CHANGED: pitch and timber' domain: now Signal
 * CHANGED: remixed has as a domain Signal, same for the range of remixer
 * CHANGED: same thing for sampled/sampler
 * CHANGED: same thing for djmixed
 * CHANGED: same thing for remix_of
 * CHANGED: same thing for medley_of
 * CHANGED: same thing for djmix_of
 * CHANGED: same thing for remaster_of
 * CHANGED: same thing for mashup_of
 * CHANGED: collaborated_with/other_release_of are symmetric
 * CHANGED: added inverse properties statements on all djmix/...
 * CHANGED: mark compilation_of as unstable. this should be done through a
 release type and through explicit links to each Signal.
 * CHANGED: translation_of goes from a MusicalExpression to a
 MusicalExpression (well, a Work is independent of its wording)
 * CHANGED: tribute_to from MusicalManifestation to Artist



 NOTE: 
 * remix_of/djmix_of should be transitive?
 * other_release_of is *really* vague...
 * compilation_of and tribute_to should be removed... too redundant with
 existing stuff, and not even shortcuts
 * musicbrainz is maybe too ambitious in its domain
