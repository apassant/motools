<p>

Internet changed the music industry.  At first, sharing systems like <a href="http://www.napster.com">Napster</a> 
allowed people to share any song they had on their computer with millions other people. 
That new reality changed the music industryâ€™s landscape for good, and many juridical battles followed. 
However, a biggest change followed a couple of years later. 
Communities like <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a> started to appear. 
Strong of millions of regular users, such communities helped garage bands and obscure musicians to create 
their musical niche: the longtail of the music industry. 
This second change is more profound than the first one: 
now any musician has the possibility to reach their audience by sharing their work on the Web. 
In the mean time, a free database called <a href="http://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a> archiving 
million of between artists, albums and tracks appeared; music suggesting services like 
<a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a> or <a href="http://last.fm/">Last.FM</a> started to appear and Apple started 
to sell individual tracks at 1$ with <a href="http://www.itunes.com">iTunes</a>.</p>

<p>At that point, the music industry of the eighties leaded by blockbusters was completely changed.</p>

The Music Ontology is an attempt to  provide a vocabulary for linking a wide range music-related information, 
and to provide a democratic mechanism for doing so. 
Anybody can publish Music Ontology data and link it with existing data, in order to help 
create a music-related <i>web of data</i>.

For example, John Doe may publish some information about a performance he saw last night (like the fact
that he was there, and a review). Mary Doe may publish the fact that she attended the same performance, that
she recorded it using her cell-phone, and that the corresponding item is available in her podcast.
 
The Music Ontology provides a vocabulary to express information ranging from this example to:
</p>
<pre>
In this performance was interpreted a particular arrangement of the Trout Quintet by Franz Schubert.
</pre>
<pre>
This work was performed ten times, but only two of these performances were recorded.
</pre>
<pre>
Ten takes of this particular track have been recorded, each of which with a particular microphone location.
</pre>
<pre>
"Come as You Are" by Nirvana was released on a single and the "Nevermind" album.
</pre>
<pre>
During this gig, the band played ten songs. During the last one (a cover of "Eight days a week"), 
the drummer from the support band joined them to play with them.
</pre>

<p>
The Music Ontology is divided in three levels of expressiveness - from the simplest one to the more complex one.
Everything is clustered around the following categories:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1:</strong> aims at providing a vocabulary for simple editorial information (tracks/artists/releases, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Level 2:</strong> aims at providing a vocabulary for expressing the <i>music creation workflow</i> (composition, arrangement,
performance, recording, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Level 3:</strong> aims at providing a vocabulary for complex event decomposition, to express, for example, what happened during
a particular performance, what is the melody line of a particular work, etc.</li>
</ul>
