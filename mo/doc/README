You can re-generated the documentation held in this directory using the
two tools `ontosplit' and `ontospec' - all you need to make them run
is a working installation of SWI-Prolog and its `semweb' package.

The gen_spec.sh script should do the job, with minimal tweaks (basically
telling the split.sh and the spec.sh where your Prolog executable lies).
