A tool should be able to get the SVN changelog, and re-generate
the changelog at the bottom of the specification document, as 
well as updating a RSS 1.0 feed.


(We may have to hardcode the mapping SVN username --> URI).

A couple of related tools: 

 * svn2cl stylesheet
 * chalow Changelog to RDF/HTML/JS converter
