Has Influenced: Lists individuals and groups influenced BY a given composer. Names that appear IN CAPS represent major, even dominating, influences. Additional enhancement regarding time lags is again provided by plus and minus signs: &apos;-&apos; indicates that the composer influenced is older than the subject composer; no designation indicates that the subject composer is older than the composer influenced, but was alive during the latter&apos;s lifetime; &apos;+&apos; indicates that the composer influenced was born 0 to 25 years after the subject composer&apos;s death; &apos;++&apos; indicates that the composer influenced was born 25 to 100 years after the subject composer&apos;s death; &apos;+++&apos; indicates that the composer influenced was born at least 100 years after the subject composer&apos;s death.</rdfs:comment>

From the original website:
Musical Influences: Lists individual and group musical influences ON a given composer. Names that appear IN CAPS represent major, even dominating, influences. An additional enhancement employing plus and minus signs before the influence&apos;s name conveys information on the time lag of influence involved. Thus, a &apos;---&apos; designation indicates that that composer died (or disappeared, in the case of group influences) at least 100 years before the subject composer was born; &apos;--&apos; indicates a death 25 to 100 years before the subject composer was born; &apos;-&apos; indicates a death 0 to 25 years before the subject composer was born; no designation indicates that the influencing composer was older than the subject composer, but alive during the latter&apos;s lifetime; &apos;+&apos; indicates that the influencing composer was actually younger than the subject composer.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:range rdf:resource="&xsd;string"/>
        <rdfs:comment
            >Genre Profile: This field attempts to provide a shorthand &apos;profile&apos; of the relative importance of the composer&apos;s output as divided up into nineteen &apos;genre categories.&apos; The profile itself appears graphically as nineteen digits, grouped into six supercategories. The nineteen genre categories so grouped are as follows:

     1a. Symphonies
     1b. Orchestral: From Stage
     1c. Orchestral: Self-Standing

     2a. Single Featured Instrument &amp; Orchestra: Keyboard Instruments
     2b. Single Featured Instrument &amp; Orchestra: Violin, Cello or Viola
     2c. Single Featured Instrument &amp; Orchestra: Other
     2d. Featured Instrument &amp; Orchestra: Multiple Instruments/Concerti Grossi

     3a. Chamber Music: Five to Nine Players
     3b. Chamber Music: Four Players
     3c. Chamber Music: Three Players
     3d. Chamber Music: Two Players

     4a. Works for Solo Piano
     4b. Works for Other Solo Keyboard Instruments
     4c. Works for Other Solo Instruments

     5a. Ballets
     5b. Operas &amp; Operettas

     6a. Sacred Vocal/Choral Music
     6b. Secular Vocal/Choral Music
     6c. Electronics-Based Music

These groupings, it should be noted, represent the same main categories into which the &quot;Basic Library&quot; file is divided. On each of these genres the output of the composer is rated on a 0-3 scale, where &apos;0&apos; means &quot;did not compose in this genre,&quot; &apos;1&apos; means &quot;produced work of only minor import,&quot; &apos;2&apos; means &quot;produced significant work,&quot; and &apos;3&apos; means &quot;produced work of major musical import.&quot; The ratings are subjectively assessed, and could be quibbled over, but in general the difference between a &apos;1&apos; and a &apos;3,&apos; at least, should be fairly obvious. Importantly, only the 222 highest-rated composers have been assessed in this fashion; further, from these 222 only composers primarily active after about 1700 have been profiled.

So, a profile that visually appears as: &apos;303-2222-1112-111-00-11x&apos; would signify a composer who produced important symphonies and orchestral pieces (but no orchestral overtures or the like from stage works), a series of moderately important works for various featured instruments and orchestra, minor chamber music works (except for some successful works for two instruments), minor works for solo instruments, no ballets or operas or operettas, minor works for voice, and some electronic music (the last being unscaled here and, when present, indicated with an &apos;x&apos;).</rdfs:comment>

Here, &quot;outstanding&quot; is defined in terms of music in general, and not the output of any one composer. The result is that quite a few composers on the list are not distinguished in this fashion; these are individuals who may have created a solid body of work from which no individual piece stands out. It should be noted the &apos;Best Known For&apos; and &apos;Notable Works&apos; fields are combined for some composers into a single &apos;Best Known Work&apos; field, as convenient.</rdfs:comment>
